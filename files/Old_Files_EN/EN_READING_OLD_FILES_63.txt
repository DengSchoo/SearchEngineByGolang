I am a 27 year old trying to go back to college after a long break from any formal schooling1 I am taking a college algebra2 class and struggling to keep up I sit behind a young man who upon first glance looks like a thug or overall someone I would never think would be able to help me learn algebra I was dead wrong Today in class we were learning linear regression which requires a lot of specific inputs3 on a graphing calculator I kept getting a number that was thousands off of the correct answer The thug that sits in front of me turns around and says I got you bro Let me see what you got After about 5 minutes I was crushing these regression formulas Now I know to never make a judgement on someone because of how they lookdress I dismissed a classmate in my college algebra class because of their appearance and was very wrong about my initial judgement very wrong about my initial judgement  rted next to blow her trumpet4:" I am the color of health and strength I may be scarce but I am precious for I serve the needs of human life I carry the most important vitamins Think of carrots pumpkins5 oranges mangoes and papayas I don't hang around all the time but when I fill the sky at sunrise or sunset my beauty is so striking that no one gives another thought to any of you "	 	Red could stand it no longer he shouted out:" I am the ruler of all of you I am blood - life's blood I am the color of danger and of bravery I am willing to fight for a cause I bring fire into the blood Without me the earth would be as empty as the moon I am the color of passion and of love the red rose the poinsettia and the poppy "	 	Purple rose up to his full height:He was very tall and spoke6 with great pomp:" I am the color of royalty7 and power Kings chiefs and bishops8 have always chosen me for I am the sign of authority and wisdom People do not question me They listen and obey "	 	Finally Indigo9 spoke much more quietly than all the others but with just as much determination:" Think of me I am the color of silence You hardly notice me but without me you all become superficial I represent thought and reflection twilight10 and deep water You need me for balance and contrast for prayer and inner peace "	 	And so the colors went on boasting each convinced of his or her own superiority Their quarreling became louder and louder 	 	Suddenly there was a startling flash of bright lightening thunder rolled and boomed Rain started to pour down relentlessly11 The colors crouched12 down in fear drawing close to one another for comfort 	 	In the midst of the clamor rain began to speak:" You foolish colors fighting amongst yourselves each trying to dominate the rest Don't you know that you were each made for a special purpose unique and different Join hands with one another and come to me "	 	Doing as they were told the colors united and joined hands 	 	The rain continued:" From now on when it rains each of you will stretch across the sky in a great bow of color as a reminder13 that you can all live in peace The Rainbow is a sign of hope for tomorrow " And so whenever a good rain washes the world and a Rainbow appears in the sky let us remember to appreciate one another
