I live in Hollywood You may think people in such a glamorous1 funfilled place are happier than others If so you have some mistaken ideas about the nature of happiness Many intelligent people still equate2 happiness with fun The truth is that fun and happiness have little or nothing in common Fun is what we experience during an act Happiness is what we experience after an act It is a deeper more abiding3 emotion Going to an amusement park or ball game watching a movie or television are fun activities that help us relax temporarily forget our problems and maybe even laugh But they do not bring happiness because their positive effects end when the fun ends I have often thought that if Hollywood stars have a role to play it is to teach us that happiness has nothing to do with fun These rich beautiful individuals have constant access to glamorous parties fancy cars expensive homes everything that spells happiness But in memoir4 after memoir celebrities5 reveal the unhappiness hidden beneath all their fun: depression alcoholism drug addiction6 broken marriages troubled children profound loneliness The way people cling to the belief that a funfilled painfree life equates7 happiness actually diminishes their chances of ever attaining8 real happiness If fun and pleasure are equated9 with happiness then pain must be equated with unhappiness But in fact the opposite is true: More times than not things that lead to happiness involve some pain As a result many people avoid the very endeavors that are the source of true happiness They fear the pain inevitably10 brought by such things as marriage raising children professional achievement religious commitment civic11 or charitable work and selfimprovement able work and self-improvement know you say "	 	"How about charades11 " I asked sarcastically12 	 	The tinkling13 laughter burst forth14 again "I don't know what that is "	 	"Then let's just walk " Looking at her I noticed the delicate fairness	 	of her face "Where do you live " I asked 	 	"Over there " She pointed15 toward a row of summer cottages Strange I thought in winter 	 	"Where do you go to school "	 	"I don't go to school Mommy says we're on vacation " She chattered16 little girl talk as we strolled up the beach but my mind was on other things When I left for home Wendy said it had been a happy day 	 	Feeling surprisingly better I smiled at her and agreed Three weeks later I rushed to my beach in a state of near panic I was in no mood to even greet Wendy I thought I saw her mother on the porch and felt like demanding she keep her child at home 	 	"Look if you don't mind " I said crossly when Wendy caught up with me "I'd rather be alone today "	 	She seems unusually pale and out of breath 	 	"Why " she asked 	 	I turned to her and shouted "Because my mother died " and thought my God why was I saying this to a little child 	 	"Oh " she said quietly "then this is a bad day "	 	"Yes and yesterday and the day before and-oh go away "	 	"Did it hurt "	 	"Did what hurt " I was exasperated17 with her with myself 	 	"When she died " "Of course it hurt " I snapped misunderstanding wrapped up in myself I strode off 	 	A month or so after that when I next went to the beach she wasn't there Feeling guilty ashamed and admitting to myself I missed her I went up to the cottage after my walk and knocked at the door A drawn18 looking young woman with honey-colored hair opened the door #p##e#	 	"Hello " I said "I'm Ruth Peterson I missed your little girl today and wondered where she was "	 	"Oh yes Mrs Peterson please come in" "Wendy talked of you so much 	 	I'm afraid I allowed her to bother you If she was a nuisance please accept my apologies "	 	"Not at all-she's a delightful19 child " I said suddenly realizing that I meant it "Where is she "	 	"Wendy died last week Mrs Peterson She had leukemia Maybe she didn't tell you " Struck dumb I groped for a chair My breath caught 	 	"She loved this beach; so when she asked to come we couldn't say no 	 	She seemed so much better here and had a lot of what she called happy days But the last few weeks she declined rapidly  " her voice faltered20 	 	"She left something for you  if only I can find it Could you wait a moment while I look "	 	I nodded stupidly my mind racing21 for something anything to say to this lovely young woman She handed me a smeared22 envelope with MRS P printed in bold childish letters Inside was a drawing in bright crayon hues-a yellow beach a blue sea and a brown bird Underneath23 was carefully printed: A SANDPIPER TO BRING YOU JOY	 	Tears welled up in my eyes and a heart that had almost forgotten to love opened wide I took Wendy's mother in my arms "I'm so sorry I'm sorry I'm so sorry " I muttered over and over and we wept together 	 	The precious little picture is framed now and hangs in my study Six words- one for each year of her life- that speak to me of harmony courage undemanding love A gift from a child with sea-blue eyes and hair the color sand--- who taught me the gift of love
