A little girl had been shopping with her Mom in WalMart She must have been 6yearsold this beautiful redhaired frecklefaced image of innocence1 It was pouring outside The kind of rain that gushes2 over the top of rain gutters3 so much in a hurry to hit the earth it has no time to flow down the spout4 We all stood there under the awning5 and just inside the door of the WalMart We waited some patiently others irritated because nature messed up their hurried day I am always mesmerized6 by rainfall I got lost in the sound and sight of the heavens washing away the dirt and dust of the world Memories of running splashing so carefree as a child came pouring in as a welcome reprieve7 from the worries of my day The little voice was so sweet as it broke the hypnotic trance we were all caught in: Mom lets run through the rain she said What Mom asked Lets run through the rain she repeated No honey Well wait until it slows down a bit Mom replied This young child waited about another minute and repeated: Mom lets run through the rain Well get soaked if we do Mom said No we wont Mom Thats not what you said this morning the young girl said as she tugged8 at her Moms arm This morning When did I say we could run through the rain and not get wet Dont you remember When you were talking to Daddy about his cancer you said If God can get us through this he can get us through anything The entire crowd stopped dead silent I swear you couldnt hear anything but the rain We all stood silently No one came or left in the next few minutes Mom paused and thought for a moment about what she would say Now some would laugh it off and scold her for being silly Some might even ignore what was said But this was a moment of affirmation in a young childs life A time when innocent trust can be nurtured9 so that it will bloom into faith Honey you are absolutely right Lets run through the rain If God lets us get wet well maybe we just needed washing Mom said Then off they ran We all stood watching smiling and laughing as they darted10 past the cars and yes through the puddles11 They got soaked But they were followed by a few who screamed and laughed like children all the way to their cars And yes I did I ran I got wet I needed washing screamed and laughed like children all the way to their cars 	 	And yes I did I ran I got wet I needed washing e I was beautiful inside and out  He meant it  My mama's love and encouragement were the spark that gave me the confidence to overcome my own doubt  I had faced adversity  encountered my problems head on  and learned not only to appreciate myself but to have deep compassion8 for others  "Hold your head up high " has been heard many times in my home  Each of my children has felt its invitation  The gift my mama gave me lives on in another generation ks  I wish she could understand how much more you can love a man who is always careful to powder the baby or who never hesitates to play with his son or daughter  I think she should know that she will fall in love with her husband again for reasons she now finds very unromantic 
	 
	I want to describe to my friend the exhilaration of seeing your child learn to hit a baseball  I want to capture for her the belly12 laugh of a baby who is touching13 the soft fur of a dog for the first time  I want her to taste the joy that is so real it hurts 
	 
	My friend's quizzical look makes me realize that tears have formed in my eyes  "You'll never regret it " I say finally  Then  squeezing my friend's hand  I offer a prayer for her and for me and all the mere14 mortal women who stumble their way into this holiest of callings
