Once upon a time the colors of the world started to quarrel All claimed that they were the best The most important The most useful The favorite Green said: Clearly I am the most important I am the sign of life and of hope I was chosen for grass trees and leaves Without me all animals would die Look over the countryside and you will see that I am in the majority Blue interrupted: You only think about the earth but consider the sky and the sea It is the water that is the basis of life and drawn1 up by the clouds from the deep sea The sky gives space and peace and serenity2 Without my peace you would all be nothing Yellow chuckled3: You are all so serious I bring laughter gaiety and warmth into the world The sun is yellow the moon is yellow the stars are yellow Every time you look at a sunflower the whole world starts to smile Without me there would be no fun Orange started next to blow her trumpet4: I am the color of health and strength I may be scarce but I am precious for I serve the needs of human life I carry the most important vitamins Think of carrots pumpkins5 oranges mangoes and papayas I dont hang around all the time but when I fill the sky at sunrise or sunset my beauty is so striking that no one gives another thought to any of you Red could stand it no longer he shouted out: I am the ruler of all of you I am blood lifes blood I am the color of danger and of bravery I am willing to fight for a cause I bring fire into the blood Without me the earth would be as empty as the moon I am the color of passion and of love the red rose the poinsettia and the poppy Purple rose up to his full height:He was very tall and spoke6 with great pomp: I am the color of royalty7 and power Kings chiefs and bishops8 have always chosen me for I am the sign of authority and wisdom People do not question me They listen and obey Finally Indigo9 spoke much more quietly than all the others but with just as much determination: Think of me I am the color of silence You hardly notice me but without me you all become superficial I represent thought and reflection twilight10 and deep water You need me for balance and contrast for prayer and inner peace And so the colors went on boasting each convinced of his or her own superiority Their quarreling became louder and louder Suddenly there was a startling flash of bright lightening thunder rolled and boomed Rain started to pour down relentlessly11 The colors crouched12 down in fear drawing close to one another for comfort In the midst of the clamor rain began to speak: You foolish colors fighting amongst yourselves each trying to dominate the rest Dont you know that you were each made for a special purpose unique and different Join hands with one another and come to me Doing as they were told the colors united and joined hands The rain continued: From now on when it rains each of you will stretch across the sky in a great bow of color as a reminder13 that you can all live in peace The Rainbow is a sign of hope for tomorrow And so whenever a good rain washes the world and a Rainbow appears in the sky let us remember to appreciate one another d a Rainbow appears in the sky let us remember to appreciate one another u need to get started 	 	3 The last thing you want to do is regret not starting 	 	Regretting what you've done is one thing but regretting what you've never done is another Lets be honest regretting what you haven't done is so much worse Especially when it's something you're adamant9 to do You don't want to be that person who regrets it 30 years from now do you 	 	2 You can adjust your actions along the way 	 	Ready aim fire You've heard of the saying right Well what happens if you spend all your time aiming and not firing You'll never hit anything That's basically what you're doing by thinking too much and not getting started Ready fire aim should be your approach You might not get it right on the first shot but you can adjust your aim as you go along 	 	It's better to make a mistake than do nothing at all 	 	This ties in with the last point I just made I don't like to make mistakes you don't like to mistakes nobody likes to make mistakes But nobody's perfect so it's impossible not to make a mistake As great as computers and smartphones are even they can make mistakes You can't get away from it And that's OK Just be sure to get started on whatever you've been delaying for so long And when you do make a mistake learn from it and get it right the next time Then you'll be way ahead I can guarantee you that
