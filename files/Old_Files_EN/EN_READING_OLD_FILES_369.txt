How do you difine yourself As a mother father daughter or any one of a myriad1 different titles Or do you define yourself by other's perception of you Do any of these come close to your own knowledge your personal experience of whom you really are  In your quiet moments in times of inexplicable2 joy have you had the overwhelming and yet clear and lucid3 feeling of total invincibility4 -- a feeling that nothing can hold you down that you can accomplish anything and everything if you put your mind to it Well that feeling is not a random5 one  What is ti that gets in the way of your exquisite6 power  In fact the infinite power that is naturally present in each and every one of us by virtue7 of own consicousness can be rendered ineffectived if not tended to properly The stress of our lifestyle the pollution of our environment and the collective stress of our world keeps us from functioning at our full potential  But there are remedies: incorporate modalities in your lifesyle that effectively combat stress and help keep you centered Some of these opinions are: Be aware of what you eat what you use -- both on yourself and in your environment Choose natural organic products  Live a life of kindness compassion8 and charity -- it keeps you connected to your center your source that infinite reservoir within you that is your powerhouse  Don't judge people or situation -- approach each moment with the potential of any number of possibilities  To connect with your real nature that is unbounded and invincible9 practice yoga and mediation10 Once you are in touch with your true nature then nothing is beyond your means-- you are truly empowered And that is an accurate definition of you xiety levels of the individual When one is angry the heart pumps a lot more blood than the normal capacity and hence it leads to high blood pressure This may also cause a heart attack So always be like the hard working duck which is calm and composed by ites expressions but padding like the hell at the bottom For human beings this means that we have to keep moving in life by hard work Never let disappointment and frustrations rule you You make your own future and destiny by following the right attitude  After all it's all in a state of mind Everyone has two opyions One is anger and the other is maintaining your composure through pacience I choose the latter one What have you chosen rk cavern24 that held the pool in a shallow basin  The floor of the cave was only a fewinches below the roof  and a mirror had been created in which all that grew on the ceiling was reflected in the still water below  Under water that was clear as glass the pool was carpeted with green sponge  Gray patches of sea squirts glistened25 on the ceiling and colonies of raft coral were a pale apricot color  In the moment when I looked into the cave a little e lfin starfish hung down  suspended by the merest thread  perhaps by only a single tube foot  It reached down to touch its own reflection  so perfectly26 delineated that there might have been  not one starfish  but two  The beauty of the refle cted images and of the limpid27 pool itself was the poignant28 beauty of things that are ephemeral  existing only until the sea should return to fill the little cave
