Youth A Poem by Samuel Ullman Youth is not a time of life; it is a state of mind; it is not a matter of rosy1 cheeks red lips and supple2 knees; it is a matter of the will a quality of the imagination a vigor3 of the emotions; it is the freshness of the deep springs of life Youth means a temperamental predominance of courage over timidity of the appetite for adventure over the love of ease This often exists in a man of 60 more than a boy of 20 Nobody grows old merely by a number of years We grow old by deserting our ideals Years may wrinkle the skin but to give up enthusiasm wrinkles the soul Worry fear selfdistrust bows the heart and turns the spirit back to dust Whether 60 or 16 there is in every human beings heart the lure4 of wonder the unfailing childlike appetite of whats next and the joy of the game of living In the center of your heart and my heart there is a wireless5 station: so long as it receives messages of beauty hope cheer courage and power from men and from the Infinite so long are you young When the aerials are down and your spirit is covered with snows of cynicism and the ice of pessimism6 then you are grown old even at 20 but as long as your aerials are up to catch waves of optimism there is hope you may die young at 80 s hope you may die young at 80 	seem antisocial; we may even forget the art of pleasantries A text can be misinterpreted too because you miss out on a speaker's intonation4 Neuroscientist Professor Sophie Scott told the BBC: "We always speak with melody5 and intonation to our voice you take that channel of information out of communication you lose another way that sense is being conveyed "	 	Of course texting and talking is the worst thing to do Who deserves your attention when two people are communicating with you It's then we have to decide who has the most interesting thing to say our study area.
