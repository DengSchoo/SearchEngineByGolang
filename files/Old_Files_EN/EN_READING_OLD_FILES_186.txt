	We are a large family  When my siblings18 and I were young  Dad was the one who took us to the beach  He sat in the car and watched as we frolicked in the shallows  Mom stayed home to ensure we had a hot meal when we returned  Perhaps Mom was happy for the few moments of alone time at home in the kitchen  as was Dad  alone in the car 
	 
	On this day  their grown children  with children of our own  treat them to dinner on the beach  Dad fishes off the dock  never swaying from his pleasantries  And  for once  Mom forgets about making dinner 
	 
	It is a day of memories  a day never to be forgotten 
	 
	My three children are in the photo  and Dad is in the background  as are two of my sisters and their children  but everyone who gazes at the poorly developed photo is drawn19 inexplicably20 to Mom's smile  In the photo  her face is raised up to the sky  To the sun or to our Creator  she alone knows  Her eyes are closed 
	 
	I remember how warm it was that day and how she had squinted21 up at me  shielding her eyes with both hands 
	 
	"Are my legs getting red " she'd asked 
	 
	My eyes brim with unshed tears as I remember the feel of her skin on the palm of my hand  Hot  The scalding tears run down my face  How I wish I could touch her one more time 
	 
	"No  Mom " I replied  "But better put some sunscreen on before you get a burn " Reluctantly  she'd sat up  the peaceful smile disappearing  and rolled her pant legs down  again 
	 
	"Save it for the kids " she said  her eyes scanning the group of children splashing in and out of the water  The whisper of a smile touched her lips as she watched for a long  wistful moment  With a sigh  she rose from the chair and moved toward the car where the coolers awaited 
	 
	"Maybe we should get lunch going " she said as she opened the first cooler 
	 
	Now it is my turn to smile  Mom was not ready to relinquish22 dinner duties  after all  On a whim23  I turn my face heavenward and close my eyes  I draw a deep breath and search for the special place Mom found that afternoon  It comes to me easily  Without pomp or ceremony  there she is  smiling again  Tears squeeze from beneath my closed lids  and I fervently24 pray that anyone who might come upon me at this moment will say my smile reminds them of Mom's smile  that day on the beach so long ago  Tender  sweet  unassuming - and despite our loss it was peaceful
