13 Do bear in mind though that many stomach upsets are largely preventable by following good personal hygiene1 practice and taking care of what you eat and drink 14 Put together a comprehensive first aid kit2 to take with you and make sure it is tailored to the environments in which you are going to be travelling That way you will know exactly whats in it and where to find each item 15 If a doctor prescribes medication be sure to take the full course Some medicines require that you continue to take them even after returning home Make sure you do this A lot of people think that simply because they are home they are safe This is not the case 16 If you become ill once home make sure that you tell your doctor you have been overseas and list the countries and regions you have visited even if your illness develops months after your return 17 When you first arrive at your hotel be sure to keep your luggage with you at all times; dont rely on hotel staff to keep it safe Many people have their luggage stolen when checking in or checking out of their hotel 18 Keep your wits about you and watch out for people standing3 too close or who appear to be listening in on your conversations They might be trying to find out which room you are in and whether you are travelling alone If they see you later on in the restaurant or by the pool they will know your room is unoccupied 19 Never accept a room on the ground floor as these are the easiest for criminals from outside to break into 20 Elevators can be dangerous places particularly for women on their own If a suspiciouslooking character gets in leave the elevator as soon as possible 21 Where possible select a hotel that has installed electronic locks Oldfashioned metal keys are usually hung up behind the reception desk so if a criminal wants to see who is in and who is out they only have to look behind the desk 22 As soon as you check in to your room test that the door lock and the deadlock4 are working If theyre not ask for a new room Whenever you are inside your hotel room make sure you use the deadlock It is also worth investing in a device that jams the door This can be a simple door wedge inserted on your side of the door or something more elaborate such as a door jammer 23 Check that your room has a peep hole so that if anyone knocks you can see whos there If you are unsure whether the person at the door is legitimate5 call reception and ask them to confirm that your caller is genuine Tell the person at the door what youre doing: if they are genuine they will understand; if not they are likely to leave before security arrives hey are likely to leave before security arrives d determine for ourselves As a saying goes one man's meat is another man's poison With that in mind we are bound to find out our favorite writers through reading and develop our fine taste in English  of cooler flavors  Most children have it--till they are told they have it--and so do old people with nothing to lose; animals  too  of course  With children and smaller animals  it is often in the shape of the head and in the chaste17 unaccusing stare; with young girls and ponies18  a certain stumbling awkwardness  a leggy inability to control their bodies  But all these are passive and appeal by capturing one's protective instincts 	 	You know who has charm  But can you acquire it  Properly  you can't  because it's an originality19 of touch you have to be born with  Or it's something that grows naturally out of another quality  like the simple desire to make people happy  Certainly  charm is not a question of learning palpable tricks  like wrinkling your nose  or having a laugh in your voice  On the other hand  there is an antenna20  a built-in awareness21 of others  which most people have  and which care can nourish 	 	But in a study of charm  what else does one look for  Apart from the ability to listen--rarest of all human virtues--apart from warmth  sensitivity  and the power to please  there is a generosity22 which makes no demands  Charm spends itself willingly on young and old alike  on the poor  the ugly  the dim  the boring  on the last fat man in the corner  It reveals itself also in a sense of ease  in casual but perfect manners  and often in a physical grace which springs less from an accident of youth than from a confident serenity23 of mind  Any person with this is more than just a popular fellow; he is also a social healer 	 	Charm  in the end  is a most potent24 act of behavior  the laying down of a carpet by one person for another to give his existence a moment of honor  It is close to love in that it moves without force  bearing gifts like the growth of daylight  It snares25 completely  but is never punitive26  It disarms27 by being itself disarmed28  strikes without wounds  wins wars without casualties--though not  of course  without victims #p#    #e#	 	In the armory29 of man  charm is the enchanted30 dart31  light and subtle as a hummingbird32  But it is deceptive33 in one thing--like a sense of humor  if you think you've got it  you probably haven't
