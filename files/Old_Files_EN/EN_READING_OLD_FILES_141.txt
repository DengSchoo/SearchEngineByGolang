We want to do well at school for an obvious reason because as were often told its the primary route to doing well at life Few of us are in love with the A grades themselves We want them because were understandably interested in one day having a fulfilling career a pleasant house and the respect of others But sometimes more often than seems entirely1 reassuring2 something pretty confusing occurs We come across people who triumphed at school but flunked4 at life and vice5 versa The former stars who once knew exactly how to satisfy their teachers may now be flatlining in a law office or relocating to a provincial6 town in the hope of finding something better The path that seemed guaranteed to lead to success has run into the sand We shouldnt actually be surprised School curricula are not designed by people who necessarily have much experience of or talent at the world beyond School curricula are not reverse engineered from fulfilled adult lives in the here and now They were intellectually influenced by all kinds of slightly random7 forces over hundreds of years of evolution shaped by among other things the curricula of medieval monasteries8 the ideas of some 19thcentury German educationalists and the concerns of aristocratic court societies This helps to explain the many bad habits that schools can inculcate They suggest that the most important things are already known; that what is is all that could be They cant help but warn us about the dangers of originality9 They want us to put up our hands and wait to be asked They want us to keep asking other people for permission They teach us to deliver on rather than change expectations They teach us to redeploy ideas rather than originate them They teach us to respect people in authority rather than imagine that in rather inspiring ways no one actually knows quite whats going on They teach us everything other than the two skills that really determine the quality of adult life: knowing how to choose the right job for us and knowing how to form satisfactory relationships Theyll instruct us in Latin and how to measure the circumference10 of a circle long before they teach us these core subjects: work and love That said it isnt that all we need to do to succeed at life is flunk3 school A good life requires us to do two very tricky11 things: be a very good boy or girl for 20 years and simultaneously12 never really believe blindly in the longterm validity or seriousness of what were being asked to study We need to be outwardly entirely obedient while inwardly intelligently and unashamedly rebellious13 d unashamedly rebellious13 		  in my mind's eye how discouraged I would get living at home for two more years under my parents' ironclad rule either getting frustrated6 at the extension or finding more value in the attention from boys ending up pregnant and working at the nearby gas station Not my idea of a future 	 	 	So every day after school my dad and I had blown out fights about where I would go to college His logic7 was very sound especially considering where I stand now three years after graduation with debt up to my eyeballs  but I just knew l would get nowhere staying in my hometown He threatened to give me no financial help at all and I said that was fine I would be able to get enough loans 	 	 	Eventually I signed my family up for a tour of the state university My dad and I toured campus and even though it was very cold my dad fell in love - or at the very least seemed very enthusiastic about every corner of the campus 		 	I could tell he was softened8 by this visit but the fights about where I was going to get the money continued until the day I packed everything up into our minivan  It was then at breakfast before we made our journey down that my dad said he was proud of me He hadn't thought I would actually leave and he was impressed As my parents dropped me off at my dorm room my mom started crying hysterically9  and even my dad teared up kissing me on the forehead which was the first time I could remember getting hugged and kissed by them in years 		 	At this point my relationship with my parents changed No longer were they the disciplinarians but they became confidants  advisors10 and an excellent support system and I became an adult Sometimes I still expect to get yelled at for my decisions but they've done phenomenally well to leave me to my own life and to just be happy when I actually call home No matter what happens now I know standing11 my ground on where to go for school has been the best decision of my life as I have gained both a good education and a precious life experience I never would have been exposed to had I taken any other road
