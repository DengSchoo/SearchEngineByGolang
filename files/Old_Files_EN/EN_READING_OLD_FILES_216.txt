As the Buddha1 once famously said life is suffering To love is to lose In the natural order of things we will eventually lose our own parents and in the natural order of thing this will happen after were already adults Except when it doesnt I lost my dad when I was young suddenly in a car crash I never had a chance to say goodbye He never had a chance to see me grow from a messed up girl into a muchlessmessedup woman He died worried about me I live with this And yet his early death shaped and transformed me in enormously positive ways I grew up Ive spent my life trying to make him proud We metabolize these sudden losses like shocks to our system and they continue to live inside of us like fault lines like the traumas2 they are Ask anyone who has experienced any kind of shocking loss and they will tell you: the air today is just like it was on that day; the scent3 of hibiscus of an oil refinery4 of powdered donuts brings it back And suddenly the tears pool in our eyes our hearts crack open We live in all the beautiful human brokenness of these losses Our awareness5 becomes our teacher Perhaps it even helps us to embrace the ordinary as the amazing turn of circumstance that it is rcumstance that it is ral resources which you can tap into to find job opportunities and connections  	 	Be humble2	 	Humility3 is an important trait for recent college graduates While it is important to have confidence when pursuing job opportunities it is also important to stay humble It is important to be aware that you don't have much experience and to be willing to take a job that you are not fond of Your goal as a college graduate isn't necessarily to find your dream job that will propel you into a successful future--it's just to find a job to help you get started Most jobs will provide a lot of value for you in terms of teaching you about the world and teaching you what it means to have a full-time4 job Don't underestimate the importance and value of learning from a company what life is like Moreover after graduation it is unlikely that you will know exactly what you want to do Be willing to dive into a job that might not be a perfect fit and learn from it  	 	Take risks	 	Your early twenties are the best time to take risks When you are older with more responsibilities taking risks will be much more difficult When you are young with fewer responsibilities however it is easier to travel try new things and explore your options Go with your gut5 and be willing to take a leap You are in a special time in your career that you might not be able to take advantage of in the future If you have an inclination6 to take a risky7 job move somewhere new or deviate8 from your path--now is the time to do it  	 	Be friendly	 	Once you graduate college you will no longer be surrounded by your peers at all hours of the day Meeting new people is more challenging and requires more effort than it did during college Because of this it's often good to remember that being friendly is the best way to meet new people Take interest in the lives of your coworkers and people around you and be willing to make new connections 12  With the exception of dried beans and coffee  there's really not much you need in those aisles13  job market  Many young people who came to the first-tier cities ended up in devastating6 failures

	When she was a little girl trying hard to be strong  she looked up at me  her big eyes brimming with tears  and asked me why she had to have Tourette's Syndrome  My heart ached to make the world right for my child  But I looked right back at her and told her the truth as I see it 
	 
	"Kendall  God gave you a pure heart  an angelic voice  a strong mind  and a beautiful presence  With all of that  he had to make it fair for everyone else "d joy in it " The steadiness in Grandpa's eyes told how much he felt it too  "I bear witness that President Kimball is a prophet  I know the Book of Mormon is true  Grandpa  Every part of me bears this witness " "Grandpa " I added quietly  "I know our Father in Heaven loves you " Unbidden  unexpected  the Spirit bore comforting  poignant8 testimony to me of our Father's love for my humble  quiet Grandpa  A tangible9 sense of Heavenly Father's compassionate10 awareness of Grandpa's suffering surrounded us and held us  It was so personal and powerful that no words were left to me -- only tears of gratitude11 and humility12  tears of comfort  Grandpa and I wept together  It was the end of August when Grandpa died  the end of summer  As we were choosing flowers from the florist13 for Grandpa's funeral  I slipped away to Grandpa's garden and walked with my memories of columbine and Sweet William  Only the tall lavender and white phlox were in bloom now  and some baby's breath in another corner  On impulse  I cut the prettiest strands14 of phlox and baby's breath and made one more arrangement for the funeral  When they saw it  friends and family all smiled to see Grandpa's flowers there  We all felt how much Grandpa would have liked that  The October after Grandpa's death  I planted tulip and daffodil bulbs  snowdrops  crocuses  and bluebells15  Each bulb was a comfort to me  a love sent to Grandpa  a promise of spring
