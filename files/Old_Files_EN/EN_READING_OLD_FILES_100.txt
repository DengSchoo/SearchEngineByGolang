The hummingbird1 was lost in the supermarket exhausted2 starving and near death as it spiraled towards the ground on helpless wings I snatched her away from the crushing carts cupped her in my hands and rushed for the exit She was tiny and soft against my palms I ran out towards the flowers She was too weak to perch3; I cupped her in my palm and held her up to each flower to drink Slowly she perked4 up and her claws tightened5 on my finger Then she spread her wings and flew on her own: a tiny sweet miracle y sweet miracle 	ilac		 	Floating past in a dream 		 	the girl floats past me;		 	Silently she goes further and further 		 	To the crumbling9 wall 		 	Out of the lane in the rain 		 	In the mournful melody of the rain 		 	Her color has faded 		 	Her fragrance has disppeared 		 	Vanished into the void;		 	Even her glance like a sigh 		 	Melancholy like lilacs 		 	Alone holding an oil-paper umbrella 		 	I wander along a long		 	Solitary lane in the rain 		 	Hoping to pass		 	A girl like a bouquet of lilacs		 	Gnawed by anxiety and resentment 	bucket list -although she called it her 'list for living' because these were things for making the most of life Sadly she was not able to achieve all of her 50 things before she died at the age of 45 	 	Creating a bucket list can certainly give us hope but some people have argued it can be used as a coping3 strategy4 to try to control something uncontrollable - death Clinical psychologist Linda Blair told the BBC that she was "not really in favour of bucket lists [they] take you away from the chance to be spontaneous5 " It's probably true that a list can encourage people to follow someone else's idea of the perfect life And also following a fixed6 list of goals makes you less impulsive7 - your aims and wishes might change as you approach the day when you finally kick the bucket 	 	But why not at least dream of what we would like to do Why not reach for the stars even if we only reach the sky Whether we want to plan it or just see what happens we don't know what tomorrow will bring so maybe we should live for today  wasted 
	       ，      。t ever was and the fans are happy  then who's going to complain  After all  you can never have too much of a good thing ing  You stress yourself out  You wear yourself out  you worry  you over think  you make stuff up in your head  and you over exaggerate  What an imagination our brains have  But seriously speaking  there's only so much analyzing you can do  At some point you're going to have to kick your ass5 into gear  At some point you'll have to put the key in the ignition  start the engine  and push the pedal  You can't do that with your mind 
	 
	4 Procrastinating6 won't get you anywhere 
	 
	Getting started is easy  simple  and doable  Yet procrastinating is also easy to do  Ironic7 isn't it  But the truth is  delaying what you've been dying to do isn't going to benefit you  At best  it'll hinder you in more ways than one  Remember what I said earlier about what we do everyday is a habit  Well If you procrastinate8 enough  that habit will creep into other parts of your life as well  If you procrastinate with simple things  you'll procrastinate with harder things  One leads to another  Start small If you must  but at the least you need to get started 
	 
	3 The last thing you want to do is regret not starting 
	 
	Regretting what you've done is one thing  but regretting what you've never done is another  Lets be honest  regretting what you haven't done is so much worse  Especially when it's something you're adamant9 to do  You don't want to be that person who regrets it 30 years from now  do you 
	 
	2 You can adjust your actions along the way 
	 
	Ready  aim  fire  You've heard of the saying  right  Well what happens if you spend all your time aiming  and not firing  You'll never hit anything  That's basically what you're doing by thinking too much and not getting started  Ready  fire  aim should be your approach  You might not get it right on the first shot  but you can adjust your aim as you go along 
	 
	It's better to make a mistake than do nothing at all 
	 
	This ties in with the last point I just made  I don't like to make mistakes  you don't like to mistakes  nobody likes to make mistakes  But nobody's perfect so it's impossible not to make a mistake  As great as computers and smartphones are  even they can make mistakes  You can't get away from it  And that's OK  Just be sure to get started on whatever you've been delaying for so long  And when you do make a mistake  learn from it and get it right the next time  Then you'll be way ahead  I can guarantee you that egin gradually to roll towards the west and the sun comes out in the blue sky  Some idle townsfolk  wearing lined or unlined clothing made of thick cloth  will come out pipe in mouth and  loitering under a tree by the end of a bridge  exchange leisurely conversation with acquaintances with a slight touch of regret at the passing of time:
	 
	“ ，     ——”“    ？        ！”
	"Oh  real nice and cool—"
	"Sure  Getting cooler with each autumn shower "

	Fruit trees in the North also make a wonderful sight in autumn  Take jujube tree for example  They grow everywhere—around the corner of a house  at the foot of a wall  by the side of a latrine or outside a kitchen door  It is at the height of autumn that jujubes  shaped like dates or pigeon eggs  make their appearance in a light yellowish-green amongst tiny elliptic leaves  By the time when they have turned ruddy and the leaves fallen  the north-westerly wind will begin to reign32 supreme33 and make a dusty world of the North  Only at the turn of July and August when jujubes  persimmons  grapes are 80-90 percent ripe will the North have the best of autumn—the golden days in a year

	Some literary critics say that Chinese literati  especially poets  are mostly disposed to be decadent34  which accounts for predominance of Chinese works singing the praises of autumn  Well  the same is true of foreign poets  isn't it  I haven't read much of foreign poetry and prose  nor do I want to enumerate35 autumn-related poems and essays in foreign literature  But  if you browse36 through collected works of English  German  French or Italian poets  or various countries' anthologies of poetry or prose  you can always comes across a great many literary pieces eulogizing or lamenting37 autumn  Long pastoral poems or songs about the four seasons by renowned38 poets are mostly distinguished39 by beautiful moving lines on autumn  All that goes to show that all live creatures and sensitive humans alike are prone40 to the feeling of depth  remoteness  severity and bleakness41

	Not only poets  even convicts in prison  I suppose  have deep sentiments in autumn in spite of themselves  Autumn treats all humans alike  regardless of nationality  race or class  However  judging from Chinese idiom qiushi (autumn scholar  meaning and aged42 scholar grieving over frustrations43 in his life) and frequent selection in textbooks of Ouyang Xiu's On the Autumn Sough and Su Dongpo's On the Red Cliff  Chinese men of letters seem to be particularly autumn-minded  But  to know the real flavour of autumn  especially China's autumn  one has to visit the North

	Autumn in the South also has its unique features  such as the moonlit Ershisi Bridge in Yangzhou  the flowing sea tide at the Qiantangjiang River  the mist-shrouded Putuo Mountain and lotuses at the Lizhiwan Bay  But they all lack strong colour and lingering flavour  Southern autumn is to Northern autumn what yellow rice wine is to kaoliang wine  congee44 to steamed buns  perches45 to crabs46  yellow dogs to camels

	Autumn  I mean Northern autumn  if only it could be made to last forever  I would be more than willing to keep but one-third of my life-span and have two-thirds of it bartered47 for the prolonged stay of the season
