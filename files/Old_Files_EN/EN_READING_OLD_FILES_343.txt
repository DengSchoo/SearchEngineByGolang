I didn't cry when I learned I was the parent of a mentally handicapped child I just sat still and didn't say anything while my husband and I were informed that two-year-old Kristi was - as we suspected - retarded1  "Go ahead and cry " the doctor advised kindly2 "Helps prevent serious emotional difficulties " Serious difficulties notwithstanding I couldn't cry then nor during the months that followed  When Kristi was old enough to attend school we enrolled4 her in our neighborhood school's kindergarten at age seven  It would have been comforting to cry the day I left her in that room full of self-assured eager alert five-year-olds Kristi had spent hour upon hour playing by herself but this moment when she was the "different" child among twenty was probably the loneliest she had ever known  However positive things began to happen to Kristi in her school and to her schoolmates too When boasting of their own accomplishments5 Kristi's classmates always took pains to praise her as well: "Kristi got all her spelling words right today " No one bothered to add that her spelling list was easier than anyone else's  During Kristi's second year in school she faced a very traumatic experience The big public event of the term was a competition based on a culmination6 of the year's music and physical education activities Kristi was way behind in both music and motor coordination7 My husband and I dreaded8 the day as well  On the day of the program Kristi pretended to be sick Desperately9 I wanted to keep her home Why let Kristi fail in a gymnasium filled with parents students and teachers What a simple solution it would be just to let my child stay home Surely missing one program couldn't matter But my conscience wouldn't let me off that easily So I practically shoved a pale reluctant Kristi onto the school bus and proceeded to be sick myself   Just as I had forced my daughter to go to school now I forced myself to go to the program It seemed that it would never be time for Kristi's group to perform When at last they did I knew why Kristi had been worried Her class was divided into relay teams With her limp and slow clumsy reactions she would surely hold up her team  The performance went surprisingly well though until it was time for the gunnysack race Now each child had to climb into a sack from a standing3 position hop10 to a goal line return and climb out of the sack  I watched Kristi standing near the end of her line of players looking frantic11  But as Kristi's turn to participate neared a change took place in her team The tallest boy in the line stepped behind Kristi and placed his hands on her waist Two other boys stood a little ahead of her The moment the player in front of Kristi stepped from the sack those two boys grabbed the sack and held it open while the tall boy lifted Kristi and dropped her neatly12 into it A girl in front of Kristi took her hand and supported her briefly13 until Kristi gained her balance Then off she hopped14 smiling and proud  Amid the cheers of teachers schoolmates and parents I crept off by myself to thank God for the warm understanding people in life who make it possible for my disabled daughter to be like her fellow human beings  Then I finally cried  in your life right now the chrysanthemums5 are in bloom  Chrysanthemums and roses " Tears clouded both our eyes  Neither of us feared this last flower of fall  but the wait for spring seems longest in November  We knew how much we would miss each other  Sitting there  I suddenly felt that the best gift I could give Grandpa would be to give voice to the testimony6 inside both of us  He had never spoken of his testimony to me  but it was such a part of his life that I had never questioned if Grandpa knew  I knew he knew  "Grandpa " I began -- and his grip tightened7 as if he knew what I was going to say -- "I want you to know that I have a testimony  I know the Savior lives  I bear witness to you that Joseph Smith is a prophet  I love the Restoration and joy in it " The steadiness in Grandpa's eyes told how much he felt it too  "I bear witness that President Kimball is a prophet  I know the Book of Mormon is true  Grandpa  Every part of me bears this witness " "Grandpa " I added quietly  "I know our Father in Heaven loves you " Unbidden  unexpected  the Spirit bore comforting  poignant8 testimony to me of our Father's love for my humble  quiet Grandpa  A tangible9 sense of Heavenly Father's compassionate10 awareness of Grandpa's suffering surrounded us and held us  It was so personal and powerful that no words were left to me -- only tears of gratitude11 and humility12  tears of comfort  Grandpa and I wept together  It was the end of August when Grandpa died  the end of summer  As we were choosing flowers from the florist13 for Grandpa's funeral  I slipped away to Grandpa's garden and walked with my memories of columbine and Sweet William  Only the tall lavender and white phlox were in bloom now  and some baby's breath in another corner  On impulse  I cut the prettiest strands14 of phlox and baby's breath and made one more arrangement for the funeral  When they saw it  friends and family all smiled to see Grandpa's flowers there  We all felt how much Grandpa would have liked that  The October after Grandpa's death  I planted tulip and daffodil bulbs  snowdrops  crocuses  and bluebells15  Each bulb was a comfort to me  a love sent to Grandpa  a promise of spring
