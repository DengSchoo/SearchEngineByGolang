Books are to mankind what memory is be the individual They contain the history of our race the discoveries we have made the accumulated knowledge and experience of ages; they picture for us the marvels1 and beauties of nature help us in our difficulties comfort us in sorrow and in suffering change hours of weariness into moments of delight store our minds with ideas fill them with good and happy thoughts and lift us out of and above ourselves  Many of those who have had as we say all that this world can give have yet told us they owed much of their purest happiness to books Macaulay had wealth and fame rank and power and yet he tells us in his biography that he owed the happiest hours of his life to books He says: "If any one would make me the greatest king that ever lived with palaces and gardens and fine dinners and wines and coaches and beautiful clothes and hundreds of servants on condition that I should rather be a poor man in a garret with plenty of books than a king who did not love reading " Precious and priceless are the blessings2 which the books scatter3 around our daily paths We walk in imagination with the noblest spirits through the most sublime4 and enchanting5 regions  Without stirring from our firesides we may roam to the most remote regions of the earth or soar into realms when Spender's shapes of unearthly beauty flock to meet us where Milton's angels peal6 in our ears the choral hymns7 of Paradise Science art literature philosophy -- all that man has though all that man has done -- the experience that has been bought with the sufferings of a hundred generations -- all are garnered8 up for us in the world of books ome  We'll handle it " To which he replied  "Are you going to help me now " No one helped Courageously5 he went on alone because he needed to know for himself: "Is my boy alive or is he dead " He dug for eight hours   12 hours   24 hours   36 hours   then  in the 38th hour  he pulled back a large stone and heard his son s voice  He screamed his son s name  "ARMAND " He heard back  "Dad    It s me  Dad  I told the other kids not to worry  I told them that if you were alive  you d save me and when you saved me  they d be saved  You promised  No matter what happens  I'll always be there for you  You did it  Dad " "What s going on in there  How is it " the father asked  "There are 14 of us left out of 33  Dad  We're scared  hungry  thirsty and thankful you re here  When the building collapsed6  it made a triangle  and it saved us " "Come out  boy " "No  Dad  Let the other kids out first  cause I know you ll get me  No matter what happens  I know you'll always be there for me "
