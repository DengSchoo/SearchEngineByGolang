I will live this day as if it is my last And what then shall I do Forgetting yesterday neither will I think of tomorrow Why should I throw note after maybe Can tomorrows sand flow through the glass before todays Will the sun rise twice this morning Can I perform tomorrows deeds while standing1 in todays path Can I place tomorrows gold in todays purse Can tomorrows child be born today Can tomorrows death cast its shadow backward and darken todays joy Should I concern myself over events which I may never witness Should I torment2 myself with problems that may never come to pass No Tomorrow lies buried with yesterday and I will think of it no more I will live this day as if it is my last This day is all I have and these hours are now my eternity3 I greet this sunrise with cries of joy as a prisoner who is reprieved4 from death I lift my arms with thanks for this priceless gift of a new day So too I will beat upon my heart with gratitude5 as I consider all who greeted yesterdays sunrise who are no longer with the living today I am indeed a fortunate man and todays hours are but a bonus undeserved  but a bonus undeserved ring a flower but it was not the little red rose they had agreed upon Besides this girl was only about 18 and Hollis Meynell had told him she was 30 "What of it " he had answered "I'm 32 " He was 29 	 	His mind went back to that book he had read in the training camp Of Human Bondage2 it was; and throughout the book were notes in a woman's handwriting He had never believed that a woman could see into a man's heart so tenderly so understandingly Her name was on the book plate: Hollis Meynell He had got hold a New York City telephone book and found her address He had written; she had answered Next day he had been shipped out but they had gone on writing 	 	For 13 months she had faithfully replied When his letters did not arrive she wrote anyway and now he believed that he loved her and that she loved him 	 	 	But she had refused all his pleas to send him her photograph She had explained:" If you're feeling for me has any reality what I look like won't matter Suppose I'm beautiful I'd always been haunted by the feeling that you had been taking a chance on just that and that kind of love would disgust me Suppose I'm plain ( and you must admit that this is more likely) then I'd always fear that you were only going on writing because you were lonely and had no one else No don't ask for my picture When you come to New York you shall see me and then you shall make your decision "	 	One minute to sixhe put hard on a cigarette Then Lieutenant Blandford's heart leaped 	 	A young woman was coming towards him Her figure was long and slim; her blond hair lay back in curls over her delicate ears Her eyes were as blue as flowers her lips and chin had a gentle firmness In her pale-green suit she was like springtime come alive 	 	He started toward her forgetting to notice that she was wearing no rose and as he moved a small provocative4 smile curved her lips 	 	"Going my way soldier " she murmured He made one step closer to her Then he saw Hollis Meynell 	 	She was standing3 almost directly behind the girl a woman well past 40 her graying hair tucked under a worn hat She was more than plump; her thick ankled feet were thrust into low-heeled shoes 	 	But she wore a red rose on her rumpled5 coat The girl in the green suit was walking quickly Blandford felt as though he were being split into two so keen was his desire to follow the girl yet so deep was his longing6 for the woman whose spirit had truly companioned and upheld his own; and there she stood He could see her pale plump face was gentle and sensible; her grey eyes had a warm twinkle 	 	Lieutenant Blandford did not hesitate His fingers gripped the worn copy of Human Bondage which was to identify him to her This would not be love but it would be something precious a friendship that he had been and must ever be grateful	 	He squared his shoulders saluted7 and held the book out toward the woman although even well while he spoke8 he fell the bitterness of disappointment "I'm John Blandford and you---you are Miss Meynell May---may I take you to dinner "	 	The woman smiled "I don't know what this is all about son " she answered "That young lady in the green suit she begged me to wear this rose on my coat And she said that if you ask me to go out with you I should tell you that she's waiting for you in that restraint across the street She said it was some kind of test "
