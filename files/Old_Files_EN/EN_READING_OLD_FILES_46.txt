 What are the things that scare you: snakes spiders or creepy crawlies Or maybe you have a fear of heights or visiting the dentist Although some of us just get scared or a bit nervous about these things for others it can cause an irrational1 reaction that cant be controlled something we call a phobia It occurs when someone develops an exaggerated or unrealistic sense of danger about a situation or object Sometimes its good to be aware of the possible dangers from things Our brain alerts us to the risks that might lie ahead but then we often rationalise the risks and overcome them Clinical psychologist Warren Mansell told the BBC: Our fears are hardwired into our brains we dont need to learn to be afraid of animals like snakes or spiders But phobias are stronger than just fears Warren says: An area called the amygdala in the brain is recognising a threat and preparing your body for fight or flight With a phobia your breathing gets quicker your pulse speeds up you sweat theres more glucose2 in your blood increasing your energy and your brain is unable to control these reactions But where does a phobia come from Speaking to the BBC Lauren Rosenberg a fear and phobia expert says: Phobias usually are a copy behaviour from a higher authority like a parent or teacher or something you have learnt from your own experience Or a trauma3 from a past event that comes back to haunt you There are many different complex phobias some people suffer from such as agoraphobia triggered by being away from home social anxiety disorder4 feeling anxious in social situations and iatrophobia fear of doctors But how can they be overcome Cognitive5 behavioural therapy is one option where you gradually get used to whatever it is you fear Lauren Rosenburg says she likes to work with people to clear their subconscious6 memory and help them breathe But if you do have a phobia continually trying to avoid what youre afraid of is likely to make the situation worse so its a good idea to find help to overcome it d idea to find help to overcome it e it arming people are particularly adept11 at seeking out shared interests or experiences to help them build rapport12 Simple things like asking where someone's from really can open up a discussion and allow you to find areas in common And if all else fails you can fall back on that most British of topics: the weather Glorious day isn't it hey decide to leave you.
