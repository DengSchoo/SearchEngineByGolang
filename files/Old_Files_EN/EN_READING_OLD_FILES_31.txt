Are you absentminded Sometimes I wish I were So many things were achieved by people who just left something in their pocket or forgot to switch off a machine Like what happened to this group of Swedish scientists According to the British newspaper The Independent they left their equipment switched on over the weekend by accident and ended up creating a synthetic1 form of the worlds most absorbent material Their experiments to create what they now call Upsalite were not going well till the cockup happened Johan Gomez de la Torre researcher at the Uppsala University said: A Thursday afternoon in 2011 by mistake we left the material in the reaction chamber2 Back at work on Monday morning we discovered that a rigid3 gel had formed and after drying this gel we started to get excited The breakthrough has farreaching commercial applications including cleaning up huge oil spills It might also have been by chance that the US engineer William Percy had a bar of chocolate in his pocket when he visited a factory which produced equipment for radars4 It was during the Second World War Percy was intrigued5 when the sweet melted and he decided6 to investigate The scientist observed the effect the equipment had on popcorn7 and other foods and invented another machine with similar technology It was the precursor8 to the microwaves we see today But we cant talk about accidental breakthroughs in science without mentioning the Scottish bacteriologist Alexander Fleming who discovered penicillin9 the first antibiotic10 in 1928 Fleming came back to his laboratory after a holiday and observed a strange phenomenon in a dish used to grow microbes He noticed a bacteria free circle around a growth of mould and realised that the mould was acting11 as an antibiotic killing12 the bacteria around it Maybe being absentminded isnt a problem as long as you have the curiosity of a scientist Get used to observing your surroundings Who knows where it might lead roundings Who knows where it might lead  o you miss when you are away from home and family  for what you have - and lots of chocolate - helps " The saying goes that 'a healthy body leads a healthy mind' which is probably why other people have recommended doing yoga and meditation4 as well as staying fit and healthy to help maintain a positive outlook on life han facing one another. Plus  can you really stay mad at someone when their hand is in yours?
