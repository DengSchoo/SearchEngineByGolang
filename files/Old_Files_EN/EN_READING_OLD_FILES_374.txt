Very much ever since you were brought into this world When you coulden't open your mouth till the first two years on planet earth inner voice is the one through which you interpreted and understood things  Inner voice is the voice mouth of the subconscious1 mind The subconscious mind is always acting2 as a secondary reflector of thoughts and ideas in the body It justifies3 and rationalizes what is right and what is wrong When we go aganist what the inner voice say we get a guilty conscious and are bothered by it throughout our lives  At times when we are feeling low or those unforgettable moments when we are let down we seem to need some kind of emotional or mental support We usually speak to our closest pal4 or our dearest family member during times of distress5 to ease the burden At such times we get over the initial drizzle6 of emotional anxiety and mental restlessness because of the pepping up by our empathic listener we suddenly feel rejuvenated7 because our inner voice alerts us to get on with things and leave the things of past on the memory books of our brain  The inner voice is always right most of the times because it knows us better than others and probably even ourselves It is the dare devil child of the intuitions which we have been having since childhood It's good to go by intuitions most of the tims because its the response provided due to the synchronism between our mental and physical being  Whenever you are trying your first cigarette or whenever you are asked to take sides in an argument you are always in a sense of dilemma8 During these times your inner voice automatically gives its verdict which when over written might leave us unhappy in the future It's up to us to either ignore the morale9 booster inside us or go out to the world and search for spiritual guru's and happiness when all these things are very much present within us e brick and mortar6 of our future  So friends  it is always better to be busy rather than idle  Now hasn't everyone heard that an idle mind is a devil's workshop  Behind every successful man is a devotedly7 followed hectic schedule rather than a woman
