In the doorway1 of my home I looked closely at the face of my 23yearold son Daniel his backpack by his side We were saying goodbye In a few hours he would be flying to France He would be staying there for at least a year to learn another language and experience life in a different country It was a transitional time in Daniels life a passage a step from college into the adult world I wanted to leave him some words that would have some meaning some significance beyond the moment But nothing came from my lips No sound broke the stillness of my beachside home Outside I could hear the shrill2 cries of sea gulls3 as they circled the ever changing surf on Long Island Inside I stood frozen and quiet looking into the searching eyes of my son What made it more difficult was that I knew this was not the first time I had let such a moment pass When Daniel was five I took him to the schoolbus stop on his first day of kindergarten I felt the tension in his hand holding mine as the bus turned the corner I saw colour flush his cheeks as the bus pulled up He looked at meas he did now What is it going to be like Dad Can I do it Will I be okay And then he walked up the steps of the bus and disappeared inside And the bus drove away And I had said nothing A decade or so later a similar scene played itself out With his mother I drove him to William and Mary College in Virginia His first night he went out with his new schoolmates and when he met us the next morning he was sick He was coming down with mononucleosis but we could not know that then We thought he had a hangover In his room Dan lay stretched out on his bed as I started to leave for the trip home I tried to think of something to say to give him courage and confidence as he started this new phase of life Again words failed me I mumbled4 something like Hope you feel better Dan And I left Now as I stood before him I thought of those lost opportunities How many times have we all let such moments pass A boy graduates from school a daughter gets married We go through the motions of the ceremony but we dont seek out our children and find a quiet moment to tell them what they have meant to us Or what they might expect to face in the years ahead How fast the years had passed Daniel was born in New Orleans LA in 1962 slow to walk and talk and small of stature5 He was the tiniest in his class but he developed a warm outgoing nature and was popular with his peers He was coordinated6 and agile7 and he became adept8 in sports Baseball gave him his earliest challenge He was an outstanding pitcher9 in Little League and eventually as a senior in high school made the varsity winning half the teams games with a record of five wins and two losses At graduation the coach named Daniel the teams most valuable player His finest hour though came at a school science fair He entered an exhibit showing how the circulatory system works It was primitive10 and crude especially compared to the fancy computerized blinkinglight models entered by other students My wife Sara felt embarrassed for him It turned out that the other kids had not done their own worktheir parents had made their exhibits As the judges went on their rounds they found that these other kids couldnt answer their questions Daniel answered every one When the judges awarded the Albert Einstein Plaque11 for the best exhibit they gave it to him By the time Daniel left for college he stood six feet tall and weighed 170 pounds He was muscular and in superb condition but he never pitched another inning having given up baseball for English literature I was sorry that he would not develop his athletic12 talent but proud that he had made such a mature decision One day I told Daniel that the great failing in my life had been that I didnt take a year or two off to travel when I finished college This is the best way to my way of thinking to broaden oneself and develop a larger perspective on life Once I had married and begun working I found that the dream of living in another culture had vanished Daniel thought about this His friends said that he would be insane to put his career on hold But he decided13 it wasnt so crazy After graduation he worked as a waiter at college a bike messenger and a house painter With the money he earned he had enough to go to Paris The night before he was to leave I tossed in bed I was trying to figure out something to say Nothing came to mind Maybe I thought it wasnt necessary to say anything peWhat does it matter in the course of a lifetime if a father never tells a son what he really thinks of him But as I stood before Daniel I knew that it does matter My father and I loved each other Yet I always regretted never hearing him put his feelings into words and never having the memory of that moment Now I could feel my palms sweat and my throat tighten14 Why is it so hard to tell a son something from the heart My mouth turned dry and I knew I would be able to get out only a few words clearly Daniel I said if I could have picked I would have picked you Thats all I could say I wasnt sure he understood what I meant Then he came toward me and threw his arms around me For a moment the world and all its people vanished and there was just Daniel and me in our home by the sea He was saying something but my eyes misted over and I couldnt understand what he was saying All I was aware of was the stubble on his chin as his face pressed against mine And then the moment ended I went to work and Daniel left a few hours later with his girlfriend That was seven weeks ago and I think about him when I walk along the beach on weekends Thousands of miles away somewhere out past the ocean waves breaking on the deserted15 shore he might be scurrying16 across Boulevard Saint Germain strolling through a musty hallway of the Louvre bending an elbow in a Left Bank caf What I had said to Daniel was clumsy and trite17 It was nothing And yet it was everythingn elbow in a Left
