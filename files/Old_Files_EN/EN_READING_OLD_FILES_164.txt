	Charm  in the end  is a most potent24 act of behavior  the laying down of a carpet by one person for another to give his existence a moment of honor  It is close to love in that it moves without force  bearing gifts like the growth of daylight  It snares25 completely  but is never punitive26  It disarms27 by being itself disarmed28  strikes without wounds  wins wars without casualties--though not  of course  without victims #p##e#
	 
	In the armory29 of man  charm is the enchanted30 dart31  light and subtle as a hummingbird32  But it is deceptive33 in one thing--like a sense of humor  if you think you've got it  you probably haven't
