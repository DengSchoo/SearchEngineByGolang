Today more than ever before education is playing an important role in the teaching of children The school has become a vital part of every community drawing children from every walk of life  The children are eager to take advantage of its opportunities emerging from their sheltered confines dipping easily into the habits of the student They are coming from far and near struggling towards an education whetting1 their appetites for knowledge forming friendships for the future Childish energy lets nothing stand in its way In their tiny hands they hold the future  The person upon whose capable shoulders rests the responsibility for their education is that unsung hero the teacher He must be fair honest understanding and intelligent He must handle every situation with the utmost dignity With a complete understanding of his pupils the experienced teacher equips himself for the classroom The students eagerly return to the classroom Youthful minds are encouraged to develop their latent talents Ah yes the creative outlets2 of the arts and the crafts Tests and examinations fill out the day as bright little minds gather knowledge form their teacher But the little hands make the time pass quickly  Contrary to popular belief the teacher's work is not through at the end of the school day Oh no Therere many unfinished chores -- blackboards to be cleaned erasers dusted and of course the ever-present parent-teacher relationship So it's to this great profession and its halls of learning that we dedicate this When the occasion arises therere times when disciplinary actions must be taken  boosted  Above this it leads to over-confidence that is harmful  Over-confidence results in unsatisfied performance levels as the seed of ego5 grows into a plant into our mind  We then imagine and make big talks just to maintain our ego  So guys don't let the seed of ego to germinate6 in your mind as this seed should be used only for you to live up to your expectations  Confidence is all about being cool calm and composed  So guys do you have it in you  If you think you don't boost up yourselves as your mind is your greatest mentor7  You are your greatest helper
