When I started out as a reporter I had to learn to really listen which didnt come easily to me Im from a family that loves to debate and argue and Im naturally opinionated Early in my career I found myself frequently interrupting my subjects but when I played back the tapes of my interviews I realized that not only were many of my interjections totally unnecessary but they were also preventing my subjects from revealing information that might have been newsworthy or profound I gradually learned to just be quiet What I most want from a conversation with others whether they share my politics or loathe1 them is understanding It doesnt mean you hide what you think or refrain from pressing someone whos being unclear or evasive But it does mean the purpose of the exchange is to tease out what a person truly believes rather than to win an argument convert them or show them up  them up 	er at the time of the infamous5 pea incident 	 	It took place at the Biltmore Hotel which to my eight-year-old mind was just about the fancies place to eat in all of Providence6 My grandmother my mother and I were having lunch after a morning spent shopping I grandly ordered a salisbury steak confident in the knowledge that beneath that fancy name was a good old hamburger with gravy7 When brought to the table it was accompanied by a plate of peas I do not like peas now I did not like peas then I have always hated peas It is a complete mystery to me why anyone would voluntarily eat peas I did not eat them at home I did not eat them at restaurants And I certainly was not about to eat them now "Eat your peas " my grandmother said 	 	"Mother " said my mother in her warning voice "He doesn't like peas Leave him alone "	 	My grandmother did not reply but there was a glint in her eye and a grim set to her jaw8 that signaled she was not going to be thwarted9 She leaned in my direction looked me in the eye and uttered the fateful words that changed my life: "I'll pay you five dollars if you eat those peas "	 	I had absolutely no idea of the impending10 doom11 I only knew that five dollars was an enormous nearly unimaginable amount of money and as awful as peas were only one plate of them stood between me and the possession of that five dollars I began to force the wretched things down my throat 	 	My mother was livid My grandmother had that self-satisfied look of someone who has thrown down an unbeatable trump12 card "I can do what I want Ellen and you can't stop me " My mother glared at her mother She glared at me No one can glare like my mother If there were a glaring Olympics she would undoubtedly13 win the gold medal 	 	I of course kept shoving peas down my throat The glares made me nervous and every single pea made me want to throw up but the magical image of that five dollars floated before me and I finally gagged down every last one of them My grandmother handed me the five dollars with a flourish My mother continued to glare in silence And the episode ended Or so I thought 	 	My grandmother left for Aunt Lillian's a few weeks later That night at dinner my mother served two of my all-time favorite foods meatloaf and mashed14 potatoes Along with them came a big steaming bowl of peas She offered me some peas and I in the very last moments of my innocent youth declined My mother fixed15 me with a cold eye as she heaped a huge pile of peas onto my plate Then came the words that were to haunt me for years 	 	"You ate them for money " she said "You can eat them for love "	 	Oh despair Oh devastation16 Now too late came the dawning realization17 that I had unwittingly damned myself to a hell from which there was no escape 	 	"You ate them for money You can eat them for love "	 	What possible argument could I muster18 against that There was none Did I eat the peas You bet I did I ate them that day and every other time they were served thereafter The five dollars were quickly spent My grandmother passed away a few years later But the legacy19 of the peas lived on as it lives on to this day If I so much as curl my lip when they are served (because after all I still hate the horrid20 little things) my mother repeats the dreaded21 words one more time: "You ate them for money " she says "You can eat them for love "
