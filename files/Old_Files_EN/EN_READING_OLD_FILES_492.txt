This last rose of summer Left blooming alone; All her lovely companions Are faded and gone; No flower of her kindred  No rose-bud is nigh  to reflect back her blushes  Or give sigh for sigh  I'll not leave thee thou lone1 one  To pine on the stem; Since the lovely are sleeping  Go sleep thou with them  thus kindly2 I scatter3 Thy leaves o'er the bed Where thy mates of the garden Lie scentless4 and dead  Soon may I follow  When friendships decay  And from Love's shining circle The gems5 drop away  When true hearts lie withered6  And fond ones are flown  O who would inhabit This bleak7 world alone ies and towns and so the habbins and habbors; antiquities1 and grains  libraries  colledges disipatations and luxuries  Were any are shippings and navies  houses and gardens  and the state of pleasure  Near great cities armories2 magazines exhanges verses warehouses4 exercises of housemanship  fencing  training of soldiers and alike  comedies such ware3 unto the better sort of person of resorts  treasures of Jews and Rows cabinets and varities  And to conclude whatsoever5 is memoriable and the places where they go  after all  which  the tourtors and servers are to make diligent6 ancrary  As for trumphy max fates weddings funerals capital excutations and such shows man need not to be put in mind of them  yet they are not to be in the coffin7 lk songs  Parisians love their music  The starry12 sky is their auditorium13  You can also hear concerts in the chateaux and cathedrals  In Paris the Music never ends  Don't miss the highlight of Paris evening: eating out  Parisians are proud of their cuisine14  And rightly so; it's world famous  Gourmet15 dining is one of the indispensable joys of living  You need a special guidebook to help you choose one of the hundreds of excellent restaurants  The capital of France boasts every regional specialty16  cheese and wine the country has to offer  If you don't know what to order  ask for the suggested menu  The chef likes to showcase his best dishes there  Remember  you haven't tasted the true flavor of France until you've dined at a French restaurant in Paris
