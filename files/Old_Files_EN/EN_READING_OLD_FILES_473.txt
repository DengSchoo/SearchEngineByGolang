DiggingSeamus Heaney  Between my finger and my thumbThe squat1 pen rests; as snug2 as a gun Under my window a clean rasping soundWhen the spade sinks into gravelly ground:My father digging I look downTill his straining rump among the flowerbedsBends low comes up twenty years awayStooping in rhythm through potato drillsWhere he was digging The coarse boot nestled on the lug3 the shaft4Against the inside knee was levered firmly He rooted out tall tops buried the bright edge deepTo scatter5 new potatoes that we pickedLoving their cool hardness in our hands By God the old man could handle a spade Just like his old man My grandfather could cut more turf in a dayThan any other man on Toner's bog6 Once I carried him milk in a bottleCorked7 sloppily8 with paper He straightened upTo drink it then fell to right awayNicking and slicing neatly9 heaving sodsOver his shoulder digging down and downFor the good turf Digging The cold smell of potato mold the squelch10 and slapOf soggy peat the curt11 cuts of an edgeThrough living roots awaken12 in my head But I've no spade to follow men like them Between my finger and my thumbThe squat pen rests I'll dig with it are useless  Every action in life is to satisfy a specific purpose  Purpose or need initiates4 planning and action on the part of the doer  The person  who wants to accomplish a specific goal  first chalks out plan  The plan is like an ideal curve  By being regular in his duties and responsibilities he works towards his goal accomplishment5 in short bursts  After every burst or period of time he tries to match his practical curve followed to accomplish the goal  with the ideal curve set in the process of planning  The closer the ideal and the practical curves are  the more is the probability of the goal being achieved in the set time  In short we identify our goals ourselves but planning of education system is just done by the education ministry6 of our are  Once we have identified our goals  we pursue specilized coursrs in the direction of our goals  This is done in a systematic7 manner  starting from the basics like schooling to major specialization like engineering  But many a times it so happens that we loose track and wander around trying to reach unreachable goals  Only realistic goals are reachable  Set achievable goals  After goal setting  debug it into small modules8  which have to be achieved within certain time frames  Once all modules have been completed  the integration9 of them all accomplishes the set goal
