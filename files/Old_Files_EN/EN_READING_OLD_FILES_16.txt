The highly addictive1 feminine fragrance2 from Yves Saint Laurent Fascinating and seductively intoxicating3 the opening notes of adrenalinerich coffee and the sweet sensuality of vanilla4 recline into the softness of white flowers for a modern young and vibrant5 interpretation6 of addiction7 Ive reviewed this before when I bought it but Ive got to the end of the bottle already and will definitely buy it again Its become my go to when I cant decide and it is such a crowd pleaser I know everyone wobbles over wearing stuff for yourself but for me tbh a lot of the time I just want something others will love And this gets compliments all the time and so I feel more confident wearing it Its warm its sweet it lasts the coffee is very subtle my only bugbear with it is its one of those ones that I myself cant smell after a while but other people still can smell it on you The bottle is great for handbag as well small and compact :Dsmall and compact :D	 week has a transition like it  	 	Monday means the end of weekend lie-ins  it's back to the routine and the realisation that there are five days ahead of the nine-to-five and according to the BBC Bitesize website "If you can't stand your job then the Monday blues can be very real " And your miserable6 Monday is followed by trying Tuesday  the most popular day for sending out job applications 	 	But is Monday as bad as we like to think it is Feeling a bit low shouldn't be confused with more serious depression caused by other factors Writing for the BBC author and presenter7 Claudia Hammond argues that this low feeling might be a myth She says: "There is a strong cultural idea that we don't like Mondays " She mentions an Australian study in 2008 about how people reflected on their mood and found the day that scored the lowest was in fact Wednesdays So when Monday comes maybe we should give it a second chance that your brain will be faster and sharper than ever before.
	If you do NOTHING else except improve your sleep  I promise you that your brain will be faster and sharper than ever before.
