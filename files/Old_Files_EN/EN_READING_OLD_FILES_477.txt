It is a strange thing that the sea voyages was there nothing to be seen but the sky see men should make diaries But in a land travel was there so much to observe For the most part they omitted as a chance or a feature to be registered than observation Let's diary therefore be brought in use The things to be seen and observed are the courts of princes espcially when they give audience to embassadors the courts of justice or they sit and hear causes And so are of consisteries explit astic the churches and the mono staries were the monuments which are there in accident The walls and the fortifications of cities and towns and so the habbins and habbors; antiquities1 and grains libraries colledges disipatations and luxuries Were any are shippings and navies houses and gardens and the state of pleasure Near great cities armories2 magazines exhanges verses warehouses4 exercises of housemanship fencing training of soldiers and alike comedies such ware3 unto the better sort of person of resorts treasures of Jews and Rows cabinets and varities  And to conclude whatsoever5 is memoriable and the places where they go after all which the tourtors and servers are to make diligent6 ancrary As for trumphy max fates weddings funerals capital excutations and such shows man need not to be put in mind of them yet they are not to be in the coffin7 unwisely  Gamblers at Monte Carlo are pursuing money  and most of them lose it instead  but there are other ways of pursuing money  which often succeed  So it is with happiness  If you pursue it by means of drink  you are forgetting the hang-over  Epicurus pursued it by living only in congenial society and eating only dry bread  supplemented by a little cheese on feast days  His method proved successful in his case  but he was a valetudinarian  and most people would need something more vigorous  For most people  the pursuit of happiness  unless supplemented in various ways  is too abstract and theoretical to be adequate as a personal rule of life  But I think that whatever personal rule of life you may choose it should not  except in rare and heroic cases  be incompatible with happiness  Man is an animal  and his happiness depends on his physiology more than he likes to think  This is a humble conclusion  but I cannot make myself disbelieve it  Unhappy businessmen  I am convinced  would increase their happiness more by walking six miles every day than by any conceivable change of philosophy
