Autumn wherever it is always has something to recommend itself In North China however it is particularly limpid1 serene2 and melancholy3 To enjoy its atmosphere to the full in the onetime capital I have therefore made light of travelling a long distance from Hangzhou to Qingdao and thence to Peiping There is of course autumn in the South too but over there plants wither4 slowly the air is moist the sky pallid5 and it is more often rainy than windy While muddling6 along all by myself among the urban dwellers7 of Suzhou Shanghai Xiamen Hong Kong or Guangzhou I feel nothing but a little chill in the air without ever relishing8 to my hearts content the flavour colour mood and style of the season Unlike famous flowers which are most attractive when half opening good wine which is most tempting9 when one is half drunk autumn however is best appreciated in its entirety It is more than a decade since I last saw autumn in North When I am in the South the arrival of each autumn will put me in mind of Peipings Tao Ran Ting with its reed catkins Diao Yu Tai with its shady willow10 trees Western Hills with their chirping11 insects Yu Quan Shan Mountain on a moonlight evening and Tan Zhe Si with its reverberating12 bell Suppose you put up in a humble13 rented house inside the bustling14 imperial city you can on getting up at dawn sit in your courtyard sipping15 a cup of strong tea leisurely16 watch the high azure17 skies and listen to pigeons circling overhead Saunter eastward18 under locust19 trees to closely observe streaks20 of sunlight filtering through their foliage21 or quietly watch the trumpetshaped blue flowers of morning glories climbing half way up a dilapidated wall and an intense feeling of autumn will of itself well up inside you As to morning glories I like their blue or white flowers best dark purple ones second best and pink ones third best It will be most desirable to have them set off by some tall thin grass planted underneath22 here and there Locust trees in the North as a decorative23 embellishment of nature also associate us with autumn On getting up early in the morning you will find the ground strewn all over with flowerlike pistils fallen from locust trees Quiet and smellless they feel tiny and soft underfoot After a street cleaner has done the sweeping24 under the shade of the trees you will discover countless25 lines left by his broom in the dust which look so fine and quiet that somehow a feeling of forlornness will begin to creep up on you The same depth of implication is found in the ancient saying that a single fallen leaf from the wutong tree is more than enough to inform the world of autumns presence The sporadic26 feeble chirping of cicadas is especially characteristic of autumn in the North Due to the abundance of trees and the low altitude of dwellings27 in Peiping cicadas are audible in every nook and cranny of the city In the South however one cannot hear them unless in suburbs or hills Because of their ubiquitous shrill28 noise these insects in Peiping seem to be living off every household like crickets or mice As for autumn rains in the North they also seem to differ from those in the South being more appealing more temperate29 A sudden gust30 of cool wind under the slaty31 sky and raindrops will start pitterpattering Soon when the rain is over the clouds begin gradually to roll towards the west and the sun comes out in the blue sky Some idle townsfolk wearing lined or unlined clothing made of thick cloth will come out pipe in mouth and loitering under a tree by the end of a bridge exchange leisurely conversation with acquaintances with a slight touch of regret at the passing of time:Oh real nice and coolSure Getting cooler with each autumn shower golden daysFruit trees in the North also make a wonderful sight in autumn Take jujube tree for example They grow everywherearound the corner of a house at the foot of a wall by the side of a latrine or outside a kitchen door It is at the height of autumn that jujubes shaped like dates or pigeon eggs make their appearance in a light yellowishgreen amongst tiny elliptic leaves By the time when they have turned ruddy and the leaves fallen the northwesterly wind will begin to reign32 supreme33 and make a dusty world of the North Only at the turn of July and August when jujubes persimmons grapes are 8090 percent ripe will the North have the best of autumnthe golden days in a year anthology Some literary critics say that Chinese literati especially poets are mostly disposed to be decadent34 which accounts for predominance of Chinese works singing the praises of autumn Well the same is true of foreign poets isnt it I havent read much of foreign poetry and prose nor do I want to enumerate35 autumnrelated poems and essays in foreign literature But if you browse36 through collected works of English German French or Italian poets or various countries anthologies of poetry or prose you can always comes across a great many literary pieces eulogizing or lamenting37 autumn Long pastoral poems or songs about the four seasons by renowned38 poets are mostly distinguished39 by beautiful moving lines on autumn All that goes to show that all live creatures and sensitive humans alike are prone40 to the feeling of depth remoteness severity and bleakness41 Not only poets even convicts in prison I suppose have deep sentiments in autumn in spite of themselves Autumn treats all humans alike regardless of nationality race or class However judging from Chinese idiom qiushi autumn scholar meaning and aged42 scholar grieving over frustrations43 in his life and frequent selection in textbooks of Ouyang Xius On the Autumn Sough and Su Dongpos On the Red Cliff Chinese men of letters seem to be particularly autumnminded But to know the real flavour of autumn especially Chinas autumn one has to visit the North Autumn in the South also has its unique features such as the moonlit Ershisi Bridge in Yangzhou the flowing sea tide at the Qiantangjiang River the mistshrouded Putuo Mountain and lotuses at the Lizhiwan Bay But they all lack strong colour and lingering flavour Southern autumn is to Northern autumn what yellow rice wine is to kaoliang wine congee44 to steamed buns perches45 to crabs46 yellow dogs to camels Autumn I mean Northern autumn if only it could be made to last forever I would be more than willing to keep but onethird of my lifespan and have twothirds of it bartered47 for the prolonged stay of the season ut one-third of my life-span and have two-thirds of it bartered47 for the prolonged stay of the season
