then we throw out green rotting mush in the future I bought P90x because I think I'm going to start exercising vigorously and yet the box sits unopened one year later What can you do now to make sure your future self does the right thing Anticipate how you will self-sabotage in the future and come up with a solution to defeat your future self  Secret #5: They make it home for dinner  I first learned this from Intel's Andy Grove8 "There is always more to be done more that should be done always more than can be done " Highly successful people know what they value in life Yes work but also what else they value There is no right answer but for many values include: family time exercise giving back They consciously allocate9 their 1 440 minutes a day to each area they value (i e  they put it on their calendar) and then they stick to the schedule  as well as contemporaries such as Michelle Obama and Sheryl Sandberg While many influencers operate effectively behind the scenes those with the ability the drive and the courage to speak persuasively13 have an additional source of powerful leverage14  Like decision-making skills speaking skills are in high demand Every day in myriad15 organizations corporations and schools vast numbers of presenters16 strive to capture the imaginations of workers and executives and students in order to drive an agenda forward Yet many people fear speaking in public giving in to a panic that closes a heavy door on a fast track to success and influence  Do not shy away from speaking opportunities Hone your message and delivery skill by repeatedly putting yourself in front of an audience gather feedback make adjustments rinse17 and repeat Summon the courage to speak and accept discomfort18 as a natural part of learning and growing Start in smaller settings first and then build up from there There's no limit to where your influence can grow with this skill  5 Have a basic understanding of current events  You can't have an intelligent conversation with your peers and clients if you're stumped19 when faced with everyday topics such as the election taxes budget deficits20 interest rates markets unemployment and the meaning of all these things to the average citizen You don't need to be an expert on these topics but you do need a basic understanding of them  Influence is about shaping opinion and embarrassing holes in everyday knowledge -- the kind that force you to awkwardly steer21 conversations into friendlier waters -- can significantly dampen your 360-degree influencing efforts To fill these gaps set aside a particular time each day to learn what's in the news Make it a daily habit It will require no more than 20 minutes  6 Think like a leader  Influence is most obvious when it happens at the front of the pack While influence can arise from any position it is also from a position of leadership that it can make the most impact  The most successful companies develop their high-potential leaders from within If you're lucky enough to work for a leadership-development powerhouse such as GE IBM or P&G you've got it made because everyone else is going to woo you to come on board with them and practice what you've learned  7 Understand communication technology  It's the 21st century and even 5 year olds know about Twitter Facebook and the latest multimedia22 platforms Social media have secured a big foothold and they're here to stay If you don't have an ongoing23 online dialogue with your customers or if you need a 19 year old to show you the ropes every time you log on to your website's forum24 you're behind ith twelve handsome princes in them  who seemed to be waiting there for the princesses  One of the princesses went into each boat  and the soldier stepped into the same boat as the youngest  As they were rowing over the lake  the prince who was in the boat with the youngest princess and the soldier said  "I do not know why it is  but though I am rowing with all my might we do not get on so fast as usual  and I am quite tired: the boat seems very heavy today " "It is only the heat of the weather " said the princess  "I am very warm  too " On the other side of the lake stood a fine  illuminated17 castle from which came the merry music of horns and trumpets18  There they all landed  and went into the castle  and each prince danced with his princess; and the soldier  who was still invisible  danced with them too  When any of the princesses had a cup of wine set by her  he drank it all up  so that when she put the cup to her mouth it was empty  At this  too  the youngest sister was terribly frightened  but the eldest always silenced her  They danced on till three o'clock in the morning  and then all their shoes were worn out  so that they were obliged to leave  The princes rowed them back again over the lake (but this time the soldier placed himself in the boat with the eldest princess); and on the opposite shore they took leave of each other  the princesses promising19 to come again the next night  When they came to the stairs  the soldier ran on before the princesses  and laid himself down  And as the twelve  tired sisters slowly came up  they heard him snoring in his bed and they said  "Now all is quite safe"  Then they undressed themselves  put away their fine clothes  pulled off their shoes  and went to bed  In the morning the soldier said nothing about what had happened  but determined to see more of this strange adventure  and went again on the second and third nights  Everything happened just as before: the princesses danced till their shoes were worn to pieces  and then returned home  On the third night the soldier carried away one of the golden cups as a token of where he had been  As soon as the time came when he was to declare the secret  he was taken before the king with the three branches and the golden cup; and the twelve princesses stood listening behind the door to hear what he would say  The king asked him  "Where do my twelve daughters dance at night " The soldier answered  "With twelve princes in a castle underground " And then he told the king all that had happened  and showed him the three branches and the golden cup which he had brought with him  The king called for the princesses  and asked them whether what the soldier said was true and when they saw that they were discovered  and that it was of no use to deny what had happened  they confessed it all  So the king asked the soldier which of the princesses he would choose for his wife; and he answered  "I am not very young  so I will have the eldest " -- and they were married that very day  and the soldier was chosen to be the king's heir1
