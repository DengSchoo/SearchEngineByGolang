A SOLITARY1 HUMAN VOICEWe are air we are not earth -- M Mamardashvili  I don't know what I should talk about -- about death or about love Or are they the same Which one should I talk about  We were newlyweds We still walked around holding hands even if we were just going to the store I would say to him "I love you " But I didn't know then how much I had no idea We lived in the dormitory of the fire station where he worked On the second floor There were three other young couples we all shared a kitchen On the first floor they kept the trucks The red fire trucks That was his job I always knew what was happeningwhere he was how he was  One night I heard a noise I looked out the window He saw me "Close the window and go back to sleep There's a fire at the reactor3 I'll be back soon " I didn't see the explosion itself Just the flames Everything was radiant The whole sky A tall flame And smoke The heat was awful And he's still not back  The smoke was from the burning bitumen4 which had covered the roof He said later it was like walking on tar2 They tried to beat down the flames They kicked at the burning graphite with their feet They weren't wearing their canvas gear They went off just as they were in their shirt sleeves No one told them They had been called for a fire that was it  Four o'clock Five Six At six we were supposed to go to his parents' house To plant potatoes It's forty kilometers from Pripyat to Sperizhye where his parents live Sowing plowing5 -- he loved to do that His mother always told me how they didn't want him to move to the city they'd even built a new house for him He was drafted into the army He served in the fire brigade in Moscow and when he came out he wanted to be a fireman And nothing else [Silence ] Sometimes it's as though I hear his voice Alive Even photographs don't have the same effect on me as that voice But he never calls to me not even in my dreams I'm the one who calls to him  Seven o'clock At seven I was told he was in the hospital I ran there but the police had already encircled it and they weren't letting anyone through Only ambulances   The policemen shouted: The ambulances are radioactive stay away   I wasn't the only one there all the wives whose husbands were at the reactor that night had come   I started looking for a friend she was a doctor at that hospital I grabbed her white coat when she came out of an ambulance "Get me inside "  "I can't He's bad They all are "  I held on to her "Just to see him "  "All right " she said "Come with me Just for fifteen or twenty minutes " I saw him He was all swollen6 and puffed7 up You could barely see his eyes  "He needs milk Lots of milk " my friend said "They should drink at least three liters each "  "But he doesn't like milk "  "He'll drink it now "  Many of the doctors and nurses in that hospital and especially the orderlies would get sick themselves and die But we didn't know that then hen l he told me he was interested in dating me on a steady basis After I explained I was more interested in a friendship he told me he would have understood has I paid for my dinner "I've practically stopped treating women on dates " he said defensively "It's safer and more comfortable when we each pay for ourselves " John has assumed that because I graciously accepted his treat I was in love He was mad at himself for treating me and I regretted allowing him to 	 	Larry on the other hand blushed when I offered to pay for my meal on our first date I unzipped my purse and flung out my wallet and he looked at me as if I had addressed him in a foreign language Hesitant I asked politely "How much do I owe you " Larry muttered "Uh uh you really don't owe me anything but if you insist"	 	Insist I though I only offered To Larry my gesture was a suggestion of rejection11 	 	Men and women alike are confused about who should ask whom out and who should pay While I treasure my femininity adore gentlemen and delight in a traditional formal date I also believe in equality I am grateful for casual dating because it has improved my social life immensely by making me an active participant in the process Now I can not only receive roses but can also give them Casual dating is a worthwhile adventure because it works No magic formula guarantees "he" will say yes I just have to relax be Laura and ask him out in an unthreatening manner If my friends are right he'll be flattered 	 	Sliding into his desk he taps my shoulder and says "Hi Laura what's up "	 	"Good morning " I answer with nervous chills "Hey how would you like to have lunch after class on Friday "	 	"You mean after the midterm " he says encouragingly "I'd love to go to lunch with you "	 	"We have a date " I smile rked as a waiter  a bike messenger  and a house painter  With the money he earned  he had enough to go to Paris #p#    #e# The night before he was to leave  I tossed in bed  I was trying to figure out something to say  Nothing came to mind  Maybe  I thought  it wasn't necessary to say anything  What does it matter in the course of a lifetime if a father never tells a son what he really thinks of him  But as I stood before Daniel  I knew that it does matter  My father and I loved each other  Yet  I always regretted never hearing him put his feelings into words and never having the memory of that moment  Now  I could feel my palms sweat and my throat tighten18  Why is it so hard to tell a son something from the heart  My mouth turned dry  I knew I would be able to get out only a few words clearly  "Daniel " I said  "if I could have picked  I would have picked you " That's all I could say  I wasn't sure he understood what I meant  Then he came toward me and threw his arms around me  For a moment  the world and all its people vanished  and there was just Daniel and me  He was saying something  but my eyes misted over  and I couldn't understand what he was saying  All I was aware of was the stubble on his chin as his face pressed against mine  And then  the moment ended  and Daniel left for France  I think about him when I walk along the beach on weekends  Thousands of miles away  somewhere out past the ocean waves breaking on the deserted19 shore  he might be scurrying20 across Boulevard Saint Germain  strolling through a musty hallway of the Louvre  bending an elbow in a Left Bank café  What I said to Daniel was clumsy and trite21  It was nothing  And yet  it was everything
