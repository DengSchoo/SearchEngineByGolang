Now and then I have tested my seeing friends to discover what they see Recently I was visited by a very good friend who had just returned from a long walk in the woods and I asked her what she had observed "Nothing in particular " she replied I might have been incredulous had I not been accustomed to such responses for long ago I became convinced that the seeing see little  How was it possible I asked myself to walk for an hour through the woods and see nothing worthy1 of note I who cannot see find hundreds of things to interest me through mere2 touch I feel the delicate symmetry of a leaf I pass my hands lovingly about the smooth skin of a silver birch or the rough shaggy bark of a pine In spring I touch the branches of trees hopefully in search of a bud the first sign of awakening3 Nature after her winter's sleep I feel the delightful4 velvety5 texture6 of a flower and discover its remarkable7 convolutions; and something of the miracle of Nature is revealed to me Occasionally if I am very fortunate I place my hand gently in a small tree and feel the happy quiver of a bird in full song I am delighted to have cool waters of a brook8 rush through my open fingers To me a lush carpet of pine needles or spongy grass is more welcome than the most luxurious9 Persian rug To me the pageant10 of seasons is a thrilling and unending drama the action of which streams through my finger tips At times my heart cries out with longing11 to see all these things If I can get so much pleasure from mere touch how much more beauty must be revealed by sight Yet those who have eyes apparently12 see little The panorama13 of color and action fill the world is taken for granted It is human perhaps to appreciate little that which we have and to long for that which we have not but it is a great pity that in the world of light and the gift of sight is used only as mere convenience rather that as a means of adding fullness to life t  However  many people have a hard time expressing their sorrow  Try watching a sad movie and allowing yourself to cry for the characters  Set aside time to let yourself "wallow" for a little while  You will feel much better after a good cry Comfort your terror  Many people who suffered from trauma5 in childhood struggle with feelings of terror  Comfort yourself through those feelings  Visualize6 yourself comforting the child you once were  See yourself wrapping a thick blanket around your terrified inner child and hold that child close to your heart  Laugh without reservation  A good laugh can be incredibly healing  Do not stifle7 your joy  Instead  express your joy by giving in to an urge to laugh  A good belly8 laugh can do wonders for a person's emotional state
