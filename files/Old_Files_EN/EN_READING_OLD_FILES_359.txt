One of the requirements of every commencement speaker is that they offer some advice Well get ready here it comes  Soon you will be leaving the company of those who think they have all the answers-your professors instructors1 and counselors-and going out into what we like to call the real world In time you will meet up with other people who think they have all the answers These people are called bosses My advice is: humor them  A little later you will meet additional people who think they have all the answers These are called spouses2 My advice is: humor them too  And if all goes well in a few years you will meet still another group of people who think they have all the answers These are called children Humor them  Life will go on your children will grow up go to school and someday they could be taking part in a commencement ceremony just like this one And who knows the speaker responsible for handing out good advice might be you Halfway3 through your speech the graduate sitting next to your daughter will lean over and ask "Who is that woman up there who thinks she has all the answers " Well thanks to the sound advice you are hearing today and that I hope you will all pass on she will be able to say "That is my mother Humor her "son in the room too  If they are managers they will make every effort to get people smarter more connected and more popular than them in their teams They're not threatened because they know that smartness is synergistic They also make sure that their smart people get to look smarter than them for the same reason  They have hidden skills that never get rolled out until they're needed They don't have any need to show their full capabilities11 for reasons of proving they're better than others  They may or may not have expensive educations You'd never know just by being with them unless you had their CV in front of you  They never ever under any circumstances make you look stupid even though it would be easy to do so They've learnt through bitter experience that the only thing that happens when you make someone look bad is you look bad yourself  how pretty the bracelet was  putting it on  and dabbing7 some of the perfume on her wrist  Teddy stayed after school that day just long enough to say  "Mrs  Thompson  today you smelled just like my Mom used to " After the children left she cried for at least an hour  On that very day  she quit teaching reading  and writing  and arithmetic  Instead  she began to teach children  Mrs  Thompson paid particular attention to Teddy  As she worked with him  his mind seemed to come alive  The more she encouraged him  the faster he responded  By the end of the year  Teddy had become one of the smartest children in the class and  despite her lie that she would love all the children same  Teddy became one of her "teacher's pets " A year later  she found a note under her door  from Teddy  telling her that she was still the best teacher he ever had in his whole life  Six years went by before she got another note from Teddy  He then wrote that he had finished high school  second in his class  and she was still the best teacher he ever had in his whole life  Four years after that  she got another letter  saying that while things had been tough at times  he'd stayed in school  had stuck with it  and would soon graduate from college with the highest of honors  He assured Mrs  Thompson that she was still the best and favorite teacher he ever had in his whole life  Then four more years passed and yet another letter came  This time he explained that after he got his bachelor's degree  he decided8 to go a little further  The letter explained that she was still the best and favorite teacher he ever had  But now his name was a little longer  The letter was signed  Theodore F  Stoller  M D  The story doesn't end there  You see  there was yet another letter that spring  Teddy said he'd met this girl and was going to be married  He explained that his father had died a couple of years ago and he was wondering if Mrs  Thompson might agree to sit in the place at the wedding that was usually reserved for the mother of the groom9  Of course  Mrs  Thompson  did  And guess what  She wore that bracelet  the one with several rhinestones10 missing  And she made sure she was wearing the perfume that Teddy remembered his mother wearing on their last Christmas together  They hugged each other  and Teddy whispered in Mrs  Thompson's ear  "Thank you  Mrs  Thompson  for believing in me  Thank you so much for making me feel important and showing me that I could make a difference " Mrs  Thompson  with tears in her eyes  whispered back  She said  "Teddy  you have it all wrong  You were the one who taught me that I could make a difference  I didn't know how to teach until I met you "
