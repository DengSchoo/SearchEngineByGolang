As a man was passing the elephants he suddenly stopped confused1 by the fact that these huge creatures were being held by only a small rope tied to their front leg No chains no cages It was obvious that the elephants could at anytime break away from their bonds2 but for some reason they did not He saw a trainer nearby and asked why these animals just stood there and made no attempt to get away Well trainer said when they are very young and much smaller we use the same size rope to tie them and at that age its enough to hold them As they grow up they are conditioned to believe they cannot break away They believe the rope can still hold them so they never try to break free The man was amazed3 These animals could at any time break free from their bonds but because they believed they couldnt they were stuck right where they were Like the elephants how many of us go through life hanging onto a belief that we cannot do something simply because we failed at it once before Failure is part of learning4; we should never give up the struggle in life the struggle in life 		 	In the end they opened a company that popularized all kinds of travel knowledge and experience and thus became the richest backpackers in the world 		Â 	The young man is called Tony Wheeler and the Irish girl is Mauren Wheeler 	Â·Â·	Â 	That is how Lonely Planet7 was born 	I drove him to William and Mary College in Virginia His first night he went out with his new schoolmates and when he met us the next morning he was sick He was coming down with mononucleosis but we could not know that then We thought he had a hangover 	Â 	In his room Dan lay stretched out on his bed as I started to leave for the trip home I tried to think of something to say to give him courage and confidence as he started this new phase of life 	Â 	Again words failed me I mumbled4 something like "Hope you feel better Dan " And I left 	Â 	Now as I stood before him I thought of those lost opportunities How many times have we all let such moments pass A boy graduates from school a daughter gets married We go through the motions of the ceremony but we don't seek out our children and find a quiet moment to tell them what they have meant to us Or what they might expect to face in the years ahead 	Â 	How fast the years had passed Daniel was born in New Orleans LA  in 1962 slow to walk and talk and small of stature5 He was the tiniest in his class but he developed a warm outgoing nature and was popular with his peers He was coordinated6 and agile7 and he became adept8 in sports 	Â 	Baseball gave him his earliest challenge He was an outstanding pitcher9 in Little League and eventually as a senior in high school made the varsity winning half the team's games with a record of five wins and two losses At graduation the coach named Daniel the team's most valuable player 	Â 	His finest hour though came at a school science fair He entered an exhibit showing how the circulatory system works It was primitive10 and crude especially compared to the fancy computerized blinking-light models entered by other students My wife Sara felt embarrassed for him 	Â 	It turned out that the other kids had not done their own work-their parents had made their exhibits As the judges went on their rounds they found that these other kids couldn't answer their questions Daniel answered every one When the judges awarded the Albert Einstein Plaque11 for the best exhibit they gave it to him 	Â 	By the time Daniel left for college he stood six feet tall and weighed 170 pounds He was muscular and in superb condition but he never pitched another inning having given up baseball for English literature I was sorry that he would not develop his athletic12 talent but proud that he had made such a mature decision 	Â 	One day I told Daniel that the great failing in my life had been that I didn't take a year or two off to travel when I finished college This is the best way to my way of thinking to broaden oneself and develop a larger perspective on life Once I had married and begun working I found that the dream of living in another culture had vanished 	Â 	Daniel thought about this His friends said that he would be insane to put his career on hold But he decided13 it wasn't so crazy After graduation he worked as a waiter at college a bike messenger and a house painter With the money he earned he had enough to go to Paris 	Â 	The night before he was to leave I tossed in bed I was trying to figure out something to say Nothing came to mind Maybe I thought it wasn't necessary to say anything #p##e#	Â 	What does it matter in the course of a life-time if a father never tells a son what he really thinks of him But as I stood before Daniel I knew that it does matter My father and I loved each other Yet I always regretted never hearing him put his feelings into words and never having the memory of that moment Now I could feel my palms sweat and my throat tighten14 Why is it so hard to tell a son something from the heart My mouth turned dry and I knew I would be able to get out only a few words clearly 	Â 	"Daniel " I said "if I could have picked I would have picked you "	Â 	That's all I could say I wasn't sure he understood what I meant Then he came toward me and threw his arms around me For a moment the world and all its people vanished and there was just Daniel and me in our home by the sea 	Â 	He was saying something but my eyes misted over and I couldn't understand what he was saying All I was aware of was the stubble on his chin as his face pressed against mine And then the moment ended I went to work and Daniel left a few hours later with his girlfriend 	Â 	That was seven weeks ago and I think about him when I walk along the beach on weekends Thousands of miles away somewhere out past the ocean waves breaking on the deserted15 shore he might be scurrying16 across Boulevard Saint Germain strolling through a musty hallway of the Louvre bending an elbow in a Left Bank cafÃ© 	Â 	What I had said to Daniel was clumsy and trite17 It was nothing And yet it was everything            ï¼Œ              ã€‚                ã€‚
