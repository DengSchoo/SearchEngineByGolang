	It is curious that our own offenses1 should seem so much less heinous2 than the offenses of others I suppose the reason is that we know all the circumstances that have occasioned them and so manage to excuse in ourselves what we cannot excuse in others We turn our attention away from our own defects and when we are forced by untoward4 events to consider them find it easy to condone5 them For all I know we are right to do this; they are part of us and we must accept the good and bad in ourselves together 	 	But when we come to judge others it is not by ourselves as we really are that we judge hem3 but by an image that we have formed of ourselves from which we have left out everything that offends our vanity or would discredit6 us in the eyes of the world To take a trivial stance: how scornful we are when we catch someone out telling a lie; but who can say that he has ever told not one but a hundred 	 	There is not much to choose between men They are all a hotchpotch of greatness and tininess of virtue7 and vice8 of nobility and baseness Some have more strength of character or more opportunity and so in one direction or another give their instincts freer play but initially9 they are the same For my part I do not think I am any better or any worse than most people but I know that if I set down every action in my life and every thought that has crossed my mind the world would consider me a monster of depravity The knowledge that these reveries are common to all men should inspire one with tolerance10 to oneself as well as to others It is well also if they enable us to look upon our fellows even the most eminent11 and respectable with humor and if they lead us to take ourselves not too seriously what that means 'You wanna watch a movie ' translates to 'Let's bone ' Most sentences uttered by men can be translated to 'You wanna f--- ' Sure let's bone but you said we could watch my favorite movie You can't ask a movie lover to watch a movie unless you plan on finishing the flick10 You better be a real good fella if you're going to interrupt Good Fellas " -Jessimae Peluso comedian and star of MTV's Girl Codestepmother and gave her a hug  I turned and saw my father and stepfather laughing together  Having always appreciated the cooperative relationship my parents and stepparents had  it occurred to me that Chuck"s children longed for the same  So Chuck and I decided12 to work hard at bridging gaps instead of creating them  It wasn"t easy  and changes didn"t come overnight  but they did come  By the time Conan was fifteen  a peace had settled between parents and stepparents  Instead of griping about child-support payments  we voluntarily increased them  And finally Conan"s mom gave us copies of his report cards and football schedules  I was proud of my kids and stepkids  After graduation  my stepdaughter married  and she and her husband built a house together  At seventeen  Conan had become a sensible  intelligent young man  With rugged13 good looks and a deep  baritone voice  I wondered what fortunate girl would snatch him up  But then came that phone call  changing our lives forever - Conan was killed instantly by a drunk driver  Over the years we"d been married  Chuck had reassured14 me that I was a parent to his children  too  He sought my opinion in matters concerning them and relied on me to make their Christmases and birthdays special  I enjoyed doing those things and looked upon myself as their second mother  But in his grief immediately upon Conan"s death  Chuck suddenly stopped seeking my opinion and began turning to his ex-wife  I knew they had to make many final decisions together  and I realized later that he was trying to spare me from the gruesome details  but for the first time  I began to feel like an outsider instead of a parent  I also knew the driver responsible for the accident had to be prosecuted15  which meant Chuck and his ex-wife would have to stay in contact  Those ugly jealousies16 from the past began to resurface when  night after night  he talked to her  seldom discussing their conversations with me  And it stung when friends inquired only about Chuck"s coping  or sent sympathy cards addressed just to him  forgetting about me and even our two children  Some belittled17 my grieving because I was "just" a stepparent  Did anyone realize my loss and pain  I"d had strong maternal feelings for Conan; he considered me his second mother - or did he  As the weeks turned into months  that question haunted me  dominating my thoughts  I became driven to understand just what my role had been #p##e# I rummaged18 through boxes of photos and dug out old journals  searching the house for mementos19  even Christmas ornaments20 he had made  There were several comforting journal excerpts21  one describing Mother"s Day phone calls from Conan to me  and a beautiful white poinsettia he gave me at Christmas  And I cherished the memories old photos brought back - his loving bear hugs after cooking his favorite meal - or a kiss for simply doing his laundry  As comforting as these things were  they still weren"t enough  One beautiful spring day  almost a year after he died  I was lovingly caressing22 the pressed rose from his grave that I kept in my Bible  Suddenly  I felt compelled to visit his grave alone  I had never done that before  but I desperately23 needed some answers  Arriving at the gravesite  I remembered Chuck mentioning that the permanent headstone had recently arrived  Chuck had told Conan"s mom to select what she wanted  As I looked down on the shiny marble surface  I noticed she had chosen a bronze sports emblem24  along with a picture of Conan that had been permanently25 embedded26 under a thick layer of glass  I bent27 down and lovingly ran my fingers over his engraved28 name and the dates commemorating29 his short life  Through a mist of tears  memories of a rambunctious30  fun-loving little boy filled my heart  The child I"d mothered part-time for so many years may not have come through my body  but I had been chosen by God to provide a maternal influence in his life  Not to take his mother"s place  but to be just a "step" away  I suddenly felt very honored to have been chosen  "It was a privilege to be your stepmother " I whispered out loud  bending to kiss his picture  Finally  a sense of peace was beginning  With a heavy sigh  I got up to leave  But as I turned to walk away  the sun glistened31 on the border of the headstone  causing me to look back  "Oh my gosh  How could I have not noticed it before " The entire border of the headstone was trimmed in gold shafts32 of wheat       exactly like a gold shaft-of-wheat pin Conan had given me years ago  Chills ran up and down my spine33  I hadn"t seen that pin in years  Somehow  I just knew it was the missing link  I had to find that pin  The ride home was a blur1  I was so excited  Finally  I was upstairs in my bedroom tearing apart my jewelry34 box  Where was it  Dumping the contents on the bed  I frantically35 tossed earrings36 and pins to and fro  Nothing  God  this is important  Please help me find it  I prayed  Turning from the bed I felt compelled to search my dresser  Rummaging37 through drawer after drawer proved futile38  until finally  in the last drawer  clear in the back I felt it  It was a small  white box with my name scribbled39 on top in a child"s handwriting  Prying40 it open  I was instantly transported back in time  Conan had been about ten years old  and it was the night before going on vacation to Florida  He was going with us  and I was packing in my room when I heard a knock on my door  Conan stood there  his eyes downcast and his hands behind his back  "What is it  son " I asked  concerned by this unexpected visit  Shuffling41 his feet  he quickly mumbled42  "I don"t know why I don"t call you "Mom" very often  even though I call my stepdad "Dad "" I hugged him and reassured him he was free to call me whatever he was comfortable with  Then suddenly  with a wry43 smile on his pudgy face  he handed me the small  white box  "You choose " he said  and darted44 from the room  Assuming I"d find two items inside the box  I opened it  Instead  I found the single gold wheat pin he"d bought at a garage sale with his own money  Scribbled inside the lid of the box were the words  "I Love You  To Mom or Connie " That had been almost a decade ago  yet as I pushed the spilled contents of my jewelry box aside and slowly sat down on the edge of the bed  it felt like yesterday  Thank you  God  for finding this pin  and for the closure that comes with it  Wiping the tears from my face  I reflected on an angelic little boy whose heart beat close to mine  I still choose "Mom "
