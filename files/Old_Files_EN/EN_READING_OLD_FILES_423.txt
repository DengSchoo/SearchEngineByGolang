I strongly believe that it is rather important to be a good listener And although I have become a better listener than I was ten years ago I have to admit I'm still only an adequate1 listener  Effective listening is more than simply avoiding the bad habit of interrupting others while they are speaking or finishing their sentences It's being content to listen to the entire thought of someone rather than waiting impatiently2 for your chance to respond In some ways the way we fail to listen is symbolic3 of the way we live We often treat communication as if it were a race It's almost like our goal is to have no time gaps4 between the conclusion of the sentence of the person we are speaking with and the beginning of our own My wife and I were recently at a cafe having lunch eavesdropping5 on the conversations around us It seemed that no one was really listening to one another instead they were taking turns not listening to one another I asked my wife if I still did the same thing With a smile on her face she said "Only sometimes " Slowing down your responses and becoming a better listener aids you in becoming a more peaceful person It takes pressure from you If you think about it you'll notice that it takes an enormous6 amount of energy and is very stressful to be sitting at the edge of your seat trying to guess what the person in front of you (or on the telephone) is going to say so that you can fire back your response But as you wait for the person you are communicating with to finish as you simply listen more intently7 to what is being said you'll notice that the pressure you feel is off You'll immediately feel more relaxed and so will the people you are talking to They will feel safe in slowing down their own responses because they won't feel in competition with you for "air time" Not only will becoming a better listener make you a more patient person it will also enhance8 the quality of your relationships Everyone loves to talk to someone who truly listens to what they are saying  a systematic7 manner starting from the basics like schooling to major specialization like engineering But many a times it so happens that we loose track and wander around trying to reach unreachable goals  Only realistic goals are reachable Set achievable goals After goal setting debug it into small modules8 which have to be achieved within certain time frames Once all modules have been completed the integration9 of them all accomplishes the set goal
