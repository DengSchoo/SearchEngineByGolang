Starting a new book is a risk just like falling in love You have to commit to it You open the pages knowing a little bit about it maybe from the back or from a blurb1 on the front But who knows right Those bits and pieces aren't always right   Sometimes people advertise themselves as one thing and then when you get deep into it you realize that they're something completely different Either there was some good marketing2 attached to a terrible book or the story was only explained in a superficial3 way and once you reach the middle of the book you realize there's so much more to this book than anyone could have ever told you   You start off slow The story is beginning to unfold You're unsure It's a big commitment lugging4 this tome around Maybe this book won't be that great but you'll feel guilty about putting it down Maybe it'll be so awful you'll keep hate-reading or just set it down immediately and never pick it up again Or maybe you'll come back to it some night drunk or lonely needing something to fill the time but it won't be any better than it was when you first started reading it   Maybe you're worn out You've read tons of books before Some were just light weights on a Kindle5 or Nook no big deal really Others were Infinite6 Jest-style burdens heavy on your back or in your purse Weighing you down all the time Maybe you've taken some time off from reading because the last few books you read just weren't worth it Do they even write new great works of literature anymore Maybe that time you fell in love with a book before will just never happen for you again Maybe it's a once in a lifetime feeling and you're never gonna find it again   Or something exciting could happen Maybe this will become your new favorite book That's always a possibility right That's the beauty of risk The reward could actually be worth it You invest your time and your brain power in the words and what you get back is empathy and a new understanding and pure wonder   How could someone possibly know you like this Some stranger some author some character It's like they're seeing inside your soul This book existed inside some book store on a shelf maybe handled by other people and really it was just waiting for you to pick it up and crack the spine7 It was waiting to speak to you To say "You are not alone "  You just want more of the story You want to keep reading maybe everything this author's ever written You wish it would never end The closer it gets to the smaller side of the pages the slower you read wanting to savor8 it all This book is now one of your favorites forever You will always wish you could go back to never having read it and pick it up fresh again but also you know you're better for having this close inside you covering your heart and mind   Once you get in deep enough you know you could never put this book down  nds  I am here to tell all of you that being a friend to someone is the best gift you can give him or her  I am going to tell you a story " I just looked at my friend with disbelief as he told the story of the first day we met  He had planned to kill himself over the weekend  He talked of how he had cleaned out his locker7 so his Mom wouldn't have to do it later and was carrying his stuff home  He looked hard at me and gave me a little smile  "Thankfully  I was saved  My friend saved me from doing the unspeakable " I heard the gasp8 go through the crowd as this handsome  popular boy told us all about his weakest moment  I saw his Mom and Dad looking at me and smiling that same grateful smile  Not until that moment did I realize it's depth  Never underestimate the power of your actions  With one small gesture you can change a person's life  For better or for worse
