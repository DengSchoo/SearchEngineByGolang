Its good to talk so some people say When I commute1 into London there are certainly plenty of people conversing2 on their mobile phones sometimes too loudly discussing and sharing personal details with a friend For me its strange that they talk as though the person is sitting next to them when they dont even acknowledge the person who is actually sitting beside them Many of us spend part of each day surrounded by strangers whether on our daily commute or sitting in a park or a cafe But most of them remain just that strangers However new evidence has shown that plucking up the courage to strike up a conversation might be good for our health Nicholas Epley from the University of Chicago and Juliana Schroeder from the University of California are behavioural scientists They looked at this silent relationship and whether solitude3 is a more positive experience than interacting with strangers or if people misunderstand the consequences of distant social connections They found that many people feel uncomfortable and intimidated4 talking to others and their research suggested that when we make an initial conversation we consistently underestimate how much a new person likes us It seems we carry a negative voice in our head telling us all the things that could go wrong and why someone wouldnt want to converse5 with us Their research involved an experiment with a group of Chicago commuters and found that every participant in our experiment who actually tried to talk to a stranger found the person sitting next to them was happy to chat From this and other research the conclusion is that connecting with strangers is surprisingly pleasant and it has a positive impact on our wellbeing Gillian Sandstrom a social psychologist from Essex University in the UK told the BBC that people are in a better mood after they reach out and have a conversation however minimal6 Its true that talking can make you feel happier and happiness can lead to better mental health However if youre an introvert7 the thought of speaking to someone new might make you anxious But the American research found both extroverts8 and introverts9 are happier when they are asked to behave in an extroverted10 manner So maybe if youre a loner its time to come out of your shell and make some small talk with a stranger it could be the beginning of a new friendship  be the beginning of a new friendship hip our words be unified7  Be someone you'd look up to
