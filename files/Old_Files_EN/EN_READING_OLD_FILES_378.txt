Last night sitting by the window and gazing into the stars I momentarily went back to my school days I was just thinking why we are made to go to school and college and supposed to complete a particular course in a specific span of time I mean why do I need 12 years of schooling1 Why is it that everyone follows the unchallengeable cycle of Montessori-school-college-graduation-post graduation-work Then a theory just seeped2 into my mind following the electrifying3 whiz of a busy mosquito that comfortably kissed my ears and buzzed away  Starting from school we learn the alphabets the words the sentence that follow Sentences lead to lessons lessons to chapters and chapters to a subject Many subjects form an academic year's curriculum Upon clearing the exams we step onto the next year of education though we did follow the entire procedure sub consciously and ceremoniously we never learnt the moral of the unsaid fact The fact is that school college and other courses act as tool to achieve our goal and dream We might dream of being a doctor engineer lawyer but without proper investment of time to gather intellectual content our dreams are useless  Every action in life is to satisfy a specific purpose Purpose or need initiates4 planning and action on the part of the doer The person who wants to accomplish a specific goal first chalks out plan The plan is like an ideal curve By being regular in his duties and responsibilities he works towards his goal accomplishment5 in short bursts After every burst or period of time he tries to match his practical curve followed to accomplish the goal with the ideal curve set in the process of planning The closer the ideal and the practical curves are the more is the probability of the goal being achieved in the set time  In short we identify our goals ourselves but planning of education system is just done by the education ministry6 of our are Once we have identified our goals we pursue specilized coursrs in the direction of our goals This is done in a systematic7 manner starting from the basics like schooling to major specialization like engineering But many a times it so happens that we loose track and wander around trying to reach unreachable goals  Only realistic goals are reachable Set achievable goals After goal setting debug it into small modules8 which have to be achieved within certain time frames Once all modules have been completed the integration9 of them all accomplishes the set goal hen I have worked too long without a break  when from the time being I feel empty and need filling up  And I am lonely sometimes when I come back home after a lecture trip  when I have seen a lot of people and talked a lot  and am full to the brim with experience that needs to be sorted out  Then for a little while the house feels huge and empty  and I wonder where my self is hiding  It has to be recaptured slowly by watering the plants and perhaps by looking again at each one as though it were a person  It takes a while  as I watch the surf blowing up in fountains at the end of the field  but the moment comes when the world falls away  and the self emerges again from the deep unconscious  bringing back all I have recently experienced to be explored and slowly understood  when I can converse13 again with my hidden powers  and so grow  and so be renewed  till death do us part e dice10 and lost  but at least you took a chance  Don't think that just because something wasn't meant to be for your entire life doesn't mean it didn't add value and was right where you needed to be at the time  In your 20s  especially if you have a family  it gets harder and harder to spend time with friends because of so many different time demands  You will be pulled in every direction and it's up to you to decide what your priorities11 are  Having a couple of close friends you can rely on can make a difference in your life  As they say "shared joy is doubled  shared sorrow is halved12 "
