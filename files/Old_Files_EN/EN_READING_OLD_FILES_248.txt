We are reading the first verse of the first chapter of a book whose pages are infinite I do not know who wrote those words but I have always liked them as a reminder1 that the future can be anything we want to make it We can take the mysterious hazy2 future and carve out of it anything that we can imagine just like a sculptor3 carves a statue from a shapeless stone We are all in the position of the farmer If we plant a good seed we reap a good harvest If our seed is poor and full of weeds we reap a useless crop If we plant nothing at all we harvest nothing at all I want the future to be better than the past I dont want it contaminated by the mistakes and errors with which history is filled We should all be concerned about the future because that is where we will spend the reminder of our lives The past is gone and static Nothing we can do will change it The future is before us and dynamic Everything we do will effect it Each day will brings with it new frontiers in our homes and in our businesses if we will only recognize them We are just at the beginning of the progress in every field of human endeavor  of human endeavor  erously and to try to deal with it  If so should we complain about our life and become frustrated3 and disappointed ever since then or should we be grateful for our life rise again ourselves after a fall  If you always complain about everything you may own nothing in the end  When we are successful we can surely have many reasons for being grateful but we have only one excuse to show ungratefulness if we fail  I think we should even be grateful to life whenever we are unsuccessful or unlucky Only by doing this can we find our weakness and shortcomings when we fail We can also get relief and warmth when we are unlucky This can help us find our courage to overcome the difficulties we may face and receive great impetus4 to move on We should treat our frustration5 and misfortune in our life in the other way just as President Roosevelt did  We should be grateful all the time and keep having a healthy attitude to our life forever keep having perfect characters and enterprising spirit Being grateful is not only a kind of comfort not an escape from life and nor thinking of winning in spirit like Ah Q Being grateful is a way to sing for our life which comes just from our love and hope   When we put a small piece of alum into muddy water we can see the alum can soon make the water clear If each of us has an attitude of being grateful we'll be able to get rid of impulse6 upset dissatisfaction and misfortune  Being grateful can bring us a better and more beautiful life  14: "I would not have been so driven to be successful and work 80 hours a week to make partner all those years  I would have lingered  I would have defined myself by more than what I did for a living "	 	10  Get a better education 	 	As the saying goes  nobody can take your accomplishments15 away from you  Education is one of those accomplishments  Many readers wished they would have either gone to or stuck to college  Whether it's to land you the career of your dreams  or to meet people from different walks of life or to learn to see things a little differently  education is always a good choice  whatever form it takes 	 	11  Consider health issues 	 	By 25 you might have noticed your metabolism16 slowing down  Looking after yourself at this time is about creating habits (and breaking bad ones) that will lead to a long life in which you're healthy enough to do everything you want to do  So quit smoking or cut back on the alcohol  As many of you said  little changes can lead to big benefits in the long run ld might make you better at what you do  If you can't be bothered to learn more about your profession  then your lack of passion could be a sign that you're in the wrong field 
	 
	11  You will reduce stress and unwind into a good night's sleep
	 
	Exposing yourself to artificial light on your cellphone  TV or tablet reduces your body's production of melatonin  which can make it difficult to get a good night's sleep  if you do so late at night  You would be wise to cut off all electronics at least an hour before bed  and replace that with a good book  which is a much better sleep-friendly alternative 
	 
	12  You will change your life
	 
	I firmly believe that if it wasn't for books  I wouldn't have achieved an awful lot in my life; nor would I have the knowledge  imagination or creativity that I depend on as a writer  business owner  and coach  I hope these reasons to read more books encourage you to unlock your potential with the power of reading said that he would be insane to put his career on hold  But he decided17 it wasn't so crazy  After graduation  he worked as a waiter  a bike messenger  and a house painter  With the money he earned  he had enough to go to Paris #p##e# The night before he was to leave  I tossed in bed  I was trying to figure out something to say  Nothing came to mind  Maybe  I thought  it wasn't necessary to say anything  What does it matter in the course of a lifetime if a father never tells a son what he really thinks of him  But as I stood before Daniel  I knew that it does matter  My father and I loved each other  Yet  I always regretted never hearing him put his feelings into words and never having the memory of that moment  Now  I could feel my palms sweat and my throat tighten18  Why is it so hard to tell a son something from the heart  My mouth turned dry  I knew I would be able to get out only a few words clearly  "Daniel " I said  "if I could have picked  I would have picked you " That's all I could say  I wasn't sure he understood what I meant  Then he came toward me and threw his arms around me  For a moment  the world and all its people vanished  and there was just Daniel and me  He was saying something  but my eyes misted over  and I couldn't understand what he was saying  All I was aware of was the stubble on his chin as his face pressed against mine  And then  the moment ended  and Daniel left for France  I think about him when I walk along the beach on weekends  Thousands of miles away  somewhere out past the ocean waves breaking on the deserted19 shore  he might be scurrying20 across Boulevard Saint Germain  strolling through a musty hallway of the Louvre  bending an elbow in a Left Bank café  What I said to Daniel was clumsy and trite21  It was nothing  And yet  it was everything
