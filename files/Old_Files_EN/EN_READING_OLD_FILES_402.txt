You follow your heart You don't care about what people say You love the adventure the risk and the fire of life You want to have a taste of new things and nobody can stop you  You live in the moment It is not about making plans for retirement1 or seeking to get stuck in a particular place You live in the moment You are in the present and not in the future  You have companions who have the same opinion Married people have married people as friends and rich people have rich people as friends People who are enjoying their youth have the same type of people as friends  You keep to fewer rules The older you are the more rules or boundaries you have to limit yourself to But this is not so for the youth - they live life with fewer rules  You enjoy alcohol2 and being with women Being a youth comes with so much energy and excitement Alcohol and women sort of adds to the excitement  You are focused on the memories It is not about the mistakes or the regrets; you are focused on having new experience and establishing memories  You have so many dreams You do not know what you really want you are not specific You want to be a chef a dancer a basketball player at once  You do not even know the time You rarely check the time because it doesn't serve you much purpose It is like every day is endless and is simply a continuation from the previous day  You are innocent3 With enjoying your youth comes innocence4 You are really not an expert on a lot of things In fact you are only an expert on few things such as the kind of alcohol that will trigger5 more excitement You really don't have a concrete answer to many things; you just live with what others offer or a call that you need to make hat rosy light was sustained  From the base of the steep wall of rock on which I stood  a moss15 covered ledge16 jutted17 seaward into deep water  In the surge at the rim18 of the ledge the dark fronds19 of oarweeds swayed smooth and gleaming as leather  The projecting ledge was the path to the small hidden cave and its pool  Occasionally a swell  stronger than the rest  rolled smoothly20 over the rim and broke in foam21 against the cliff  But the intervals22 between such swells23 were lo ng enough to admit me to the ledge and long enough for a glimpse of that fairy pool  so seldom and so briefly exposed  And so I knelt on the wet carpet of sea moss and looked back into the dark cavern24 that held the pool in a shallow basin  The floor of the cave was only a fewinches below the roof  and a mirror had been created in which all that grew on the ceiling was reflected in the still water below  Under water that was clear as glass the pool was carpeted with green sponge  Gray patches of sea squirts glistened25 on the ceiling and colonies of raft coral were a pale apricot color  In the moment when I looked into the cave a little e lfin starfish hung down  suspended by the merest thread  perhaps by only a single tube foot  It reached down to touch its own reflection  so perfectly26 delineated that there might have been  not one starfish  but two  The beauty of the refle cted images and of the limpid27 pool itself was the poignant28 beauty of things that are ephemeral  existing only until the sea should return to fill the little cave  escape from the problems of gravity
