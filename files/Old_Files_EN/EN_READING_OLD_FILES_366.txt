Carbon and oxygen taken together one atom each gives you the deadly gas carbon monoxide On the other hand these very two elements on some other proportion provide us with carbon dioxide the harmless gas When these basic elements can behave in this way so can the human mind  All human beings inhale1 the air from this very earth consume nearly the same kind of food and live under the same sky gaining energy from its only source Sun Then what makes an individual distinct from each other It's the attitude the behavior that distinguishes one from other person The thought process going on in our brains is what differs  Solely2 our brains control our body which in turn controls our living our peace and happiness and overall progress as an individual What we input3 is what we get What we think is what we develop into What we feed into our brains is what we get the outcome as On reaping good thoughts and positive attitude in our minds the good follows Bad thoughts creeping in should be plucked and thrown off as soon as possible  Human body takes commands from its brains and works Our brains are functional4 always So any kind of thought nurtured5 in our brains remain there even when we are not aware of their presence These thoughts are processed without our conscious and the result follows These outcomes can change our lives At times when wrong words are spoken they remain in our sub-conscious minds without our awareness6 and the wrong follows  Brain as a physical thing is not aware of what is right and what is wrong When we think about things in some way and the perspective with what we look at them for the first time remain in our mind Our mind intends to take this perspective as true and makes way for it to follow So on thinking well the good happens and wrong thought brings unhappy situations Human beings learn from the situations faced in life and their thinking is affected7 by the circumstances faced This in turn affects the thinking Thus our life and our thoughts are mutually related To lead a good life it is desired to think good  So is rightly said "What you think is not what you are but what you THINK is what you are "kers cornered me in the break room "Guess you got to Jack " they said "You must have told him off good " I shook my head "Jack and I are becoming friends " I said in faith I refused to talk about him Every time I saw Jack in the hall I smiled at him After all that's what friends do  One year after our "talk " I discovered I had breast cancer I was thirty-two the mother of three beautiful young children and scared The cancer had metastasized to my lymph nodes and the statistics were not great for long-term survival After my surgery friends and loved ones visited and tried to find the right words No one knew what to say and many said the wrong things Others wept and I tried to encourage them I clung to hope myself  One day Jack stood awkwardly in the doorway8 of my small darkened hospital room I waved him in with a smile He walked over to my bed and without a word placed a bundle beside me Inside the package lay several bulbs  "Tulips " he said  I grinned not understanding  He shuffled9 his feet then cleared his throat "If you plant them when you get home they'll come up next spring I just wanted you to know that I think you'll be there to see them when they come up " Tears clouded my eyes and I reached out my hand "Thank you " I whispered  Jack grasped my hand and gruffly replied "You're welcome You can't see it now but next spring you'll see the colors I picked out for you I think you'll like them " He turned and left without another word  For ten years I have watched those red-and-white striped tulips push their way through the soil every spring  In a moment when I prayed for just the right word a man with very few words said all the right things  After all that's what friends do
