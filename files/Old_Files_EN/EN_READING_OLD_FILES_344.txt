"If I died today how would I feel about my life " Life is fragile  A good friend of mine called me today and shared that his girlfriend's brother passed away last night He was married with two young children He died of a massive heart attack in the middle of the night And he was only 44 years old  "It could never happen to me " we think "I'm too young to die " But how young is "too young to die " We really don't know how many days or years we will live An accident such as by plane automobile1 or other mishap2 could claim our life Or perhaps an unusual illness Or a vital organ could fail  So what would we say if our life were to end today Would we be satisfied Would we know that we had lived our life fully3 on purpose Could we feel we "did it right " It is a hard question to answer I recently had a cousin pass away from cancer I don't know how she would have answered this question But I'm 99% positive she wasn't "ready" to go Not with two little ones and a loving husband and so much life ahead of her (she was 35 years old)  If we live our life completely every day we still may not be thrilled with the thought of death However death is really only a passing from one physical body to our more complete spiritual one (not that our spirit isn't the core essence of who we are now)  Are there things we can be doing better Are there people we can love better Can we live our aspirations4 today If we know the answer what are we waiting for to make us do it Death Life is fragile Now is the time to live fully and bless those friends and family who grace us with their love wers  I am very old  I have seen everything and I am none the wiser for the pain and suffering and I have witnessed since I rose from the bowels11 of the earth  I have witnessed the conflict  the death  the civilizations  and the societies that have come before you  Yet I remain mystified about this day  I feel sad yet alive with a purpose  I have come to know those who are now an integral part of the reason for my being here at this place and time  That purpose has become apparent as I stand before you on this day while your brethren gather to witness my reflections and the changes of light that mirror your soul  I am a reflection of you  I am all of you  I am your spirit   I am The Wall
