Every day is a new day in our life  There is much to do today  The early morning sun inspires us to start things freshly and put back our past  Only a handful of us make use of this fresh bunch of energy  In various walis of life this affects the way we behave and our confidence level  Confidence is a key to survive in this world  It is the only key tool to win the rat race in every walk of life  Confidence in ones owns capabilities1 combined with sincere efforts help one to achieve unthinkable heights  But many times we see that this basic element of confidence is missing in us  As a result of lack of confidence we perform well below our caliber2  Be it in a public speech proposing your beloved visas for your college or in an interview or say even on the eve before your exams  This can be due to fear of being rejected or any other reason  If we look into our hearts and think we will come to know that fear inside us I going to get us nowhere  The confidence inside us is going to take us places  This is because with confidence we can put our thoughts into words in a better and pleasing way  So we have to get out of that shell where we think whether people will accept us as we are  Instead of living in these unending moments of fear and thoughtless analysis it is better if we project ourselves with the skills we have with the gloss3 of confidence  With confidence we can portray4 the finer points of our personality in such a way that the places where we do lack are never highlighted  Confidence should glow in us only till the point where our personality is boosted  Above this it leads to over-confidence that is harmful  Over-confidence results in unsatisfied performance levels as the seed of ego5 grows into a plant into our mind  We then imagine and make big talks just to maintain our ego  So guys don't let the seed of ego to germinate6 in your mind as this seed should be used only for you to live up to your expectations  Confidence is all about being cool calm and composed  So guys do you have it in you  If you think you don't boost up yourselves as your mind is your greatest mentor7  You are your greatest helper
