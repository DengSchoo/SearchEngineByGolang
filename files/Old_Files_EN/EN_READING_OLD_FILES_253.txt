I will love the meek6 for they are divine I will love the rich for they are yet lonely  I will love the poor for they are so many I will love the young for the faith they hold; I will love the old for the wisdom they share I will love the beautiful for their eyes of sadness; I will love the ugly for their souls of peace  But how will I react to the actions of others With love For just as love is my weapon to open the hearts of men love is also my shield to repulse7 the arrows of hate and the spears of anger Adversity and discouragement will beat against my new shield and become as the softest of rains  And how will I confront each whom I meet In only one way In silence and myself I will address him and say "I love you" Though spoken in silence these words will shine in my eyes unwrinkled my brow bring a smile to my lips and echo in my voice; and his heart will be opened ged14 women don't have to run marathons or go all-out for the emotional benefits of physical activity to kick in And in fact a study found that moderate intensity15 exercise  as opposed to intense exercise  caused more women to report later that they were in a better mood and to have greater feelings of energy psychological well-being and "self-efficacy "	 	8 They don't try to be  happy 	 	Oops Now that we've told you the secrets for happiness we're here to dash your dreams A prominent study shows that making happiness a personal goal will actually stand in the way of your achieving it The researchers found that women who valued happiness more reported being less happy and more depressed16 than women who didn't place much importance on the goal 	 	"Wanting to be happy can make you less happy " said study researcher Iris17 Mauss "If you explicitly18 and purposely focus on happiness that appears to have a self-defeating quality "	 	So if you really want to be happy try forgetting about it ed him into a room where we could be alone  I knelt to his height and admired his young face  the large blue eyes  the dusting of freckles15 on his nose and cheeks  the dimple on one side  He looked at my moist eyes quizzically #p#    #e# "Patrick  do you remember when you asked me why you had never seen me cry " He nodded  "Well  I"m crying now " "Why  Dad " "Your singing was so wonderful it made me cry " Patrick smiled proudly and flew into my arms  "Sometimes " my son said into my shoulder  "life is so beautiful you have to cry " Our moment together was over too soon  Untold16 treasures awaited our five-year-old beneath the tree at home  but I wasn"t ready for the traditional plunge17 into Christmas just yet  I handed Catherine the keys and set off for the mile-long hike home  The night was cold and crisp  I crossed a park and admired the full moon hanging low over a neighborhood brightly lit in the colors of the season  As I turned toward home  I met a car moving slowly down the street  a family taking in the area"s Christmas lights  Someone rolled down a window  "Merry Christmas " a child"s voice yelled out to me  "Merry Christmas " I yelled back  And the tears began to flow all over again ting my death  But I realized that life was too good to give up  so I cheated death  by a hair  "where am I  And who are you " I asked in a weary voice  "You're home  and my name's Steve " said the voice  "What " That was I could say before I slumped20 into a deep sleep     "Joey  Joey " said a mysterious voice  I opened my eyes  "Joey  Joey " repeated the voice  I looked at my surroundings  and found out that I was in a hospital bed  and that I was not alone  I looked at my visitor  He had blue eyes  brown hair  a gaunt face  all of the features that Steve had  I gasped21  "Steve " I asked  "Yes " he replied  "But  you're- " "No  I didn't die " he replied  "But  how " "It doesn't matter now  but I'll tell you someday  The main priority for you is to get better " he said  "Don't worry  your parents will be here soon " I smiled and thought in my head  "So many good things happened in my life  and so many of them lost  But this adventure  I shall never forget " I took one last look around me  and then I closed my eyes
