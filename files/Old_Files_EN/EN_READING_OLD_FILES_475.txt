Welcome to Faith Radio Online-Simply to Relax I'm Faith This is my first radio show; first of all I would like to thank you for clicking and entering into my radio program  Today let us share the key to living a life of love  The key to living a life of love peace and prosperity is to live from your Heart  When you live from your Heart you feel full rich and life seems to flow effortlessly You feel in control confident connected to your life's purpose You feel Joy and deep inner Peace You feel Alive  When love radiates from your Heart you feel vibrant1 energized2 and blissful The feeling of being on purpose inspires you to new heights some you never dreamed possible  Living from Your Heart keeps you focused on what is most important to you in your life You move from focusing on conflict to re-focusing on what is most important to you Your Deepest Heart's Desires  In your Heart holds the Secret to true happiness The Secret is Love Love is the tender expression of the Heart an expression we all long to feel deep within n ile in my face  parrot tulips wave their beaky petals5  and fragrant6 white blossoms are pinned to dogwood trees like bows in a young girl's hair  The evening is soft  I need my thin jacket  It's still light out when I walk home from the Metro7  I could walk for hours  Like a kid playing street games with her friends  I don't want to go in  When I went to work this morning  I left my windows open  Spring came in through the screens while I was gone  It's as if I had used a big sliver8 key and rolled back the roof like a lid on a sardine9 can  The indoors smell like the outdoors  It will be like lying down in the grass to sleep  The sheets are cool  The quilt is warm  The light fades outside my windows  This weekend  I think I'll wash my car
