	He started toward her  forgetting to notice that she was wearing no rose  and as he moved  a small  provocative4 smile curved her lips 
	 
	"Going my way  soldier " she murmured  He made one step closer to her  Then he saw Hollis Meynell 
	 
	She was standing3 almost directly behind the girl  a woman well past 40  her graying hair tucked under a worn hat  She was more than plump; her thick ankled feet were thrust into low-heeled shoes 
	 
	But she wore a red rose on her rumpled5 coat  The girl in the green suit was walking quickly  Blandford felt as though he were being split into two  so keen was his desire to follow the girl  yet so deep was his longing6 for the woman whose spirit had truly companioned and upheld his own; and there she stood  He could see her pale  plump face was gentle and sensible; her grey eyes had a warm twinkle 
	 
	Lieutenant Blandford did not hesitate  His fingers gripped the worn copy of Human Bondage which was to identify him to her  This would not be love  but it would be something precious  a friendship that he had been and must ever be grateful…

	The woman smiled  "I don't know what this is all about  son " she answered  "That young lady in the green suit  she begged me to wear this rose on my coat  And she said that if you ask me to go out with you  I should tell you that she's waiting for you in that restraint across the street  She said it was some kind of test "
