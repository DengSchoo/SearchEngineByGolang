You've been working out regularly for quite a while but you're nowhere near your fitness goals So now it's time to bring in your ultimate weapon -- your mind  Rather than thinking of fitness as something mysterious that you do with your body take an analytical1 goal-oriented approach to making physical improvements that stick Try these tips for creating a smart fitness plan:  Define your goals Whether it's to lose fat and gain muscle or to run a triathlon it's vital to have a goal to work toward Knowing where you're going makes it easier to take the right steps  Get realistic Training gains are met through consistent effort over a period of time Don't expect dramatic overnight results -- regardless of what exercise equipment informercials claim Reward yourself for all the little positive steps you take and for consistently striving forward  Be yourself Work toward a goal that you can achieve with your body Don't try to change your basic shape or to go against your own unique physical capabilities2 Take an objective look at yourself then work toward enhancing what you've got rather than trying to attain3 someone else's body ecome different                                                                                                              If you leave me  please don't comfort me because each sewing has to meet stinging3 pain                            Don't forget the things you once you owned  Treasure the things you can't get  Don't give up the things that belong to you and keep those lost things in memory                                             n  The day was  after all  to be fair  Later  as I stood above the tide near the entrance to the pool  the promise of that rosy light was sustained  From the base of the steep wall of rock on which I stood  a moss15 covered ledge16 jutted17 seaward into deep water  In the surge at the rim18 of the ledge the dark fronds19 of oarweeds swayed smooth and gleaming as leather  The projecting ledge was the path to the small hidden cave and its pool  Occasionally a swell  stronger than the rest  rolled smoothly20 over the rim and broke in foam21 against the cliff  But the intervals22 between such swells23 were lo ng enough to admit me to the ledge and long enough for a glimpse of that fairy pool  so seldom and so briefly exposed  And so I knelt on the wet carpet of sea moss and looked back into the dark cavern24 that held the pool in a shallow basin  The floor of the cave was only a fewinches below the roof  and a mirror had been created in which all that grew on the ceiling was reflected in the still water below  Under water that was clear as glass the pool was carpeted with green sponge  Gray patches of sea squirts glistened25 on the ceiling and colonies of raft coral were a pale apricot color  In the moment when I looked into the cave a little e lfin starfish hung down  suspended by the merest thread  perhaps by only a single tube foot  It reached down to touch its own reflection  so perfectly26 delineated that there might have been  not one starfish  but two  The beauty of the refle cted images and of the limpid27 pool itself was the poignant28 beauty of things that are ephemeral  existing only until the sea should return to fill the little cave
