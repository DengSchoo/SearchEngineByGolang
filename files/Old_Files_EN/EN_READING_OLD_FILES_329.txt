A sad thing in life is when you meet someone who means a lot to you only to find out in the end that it was never meant to be and you just have to let go  It hurts to love someone and not be loved in return But what is more painful is to love someone and never find the courage to let that person know how you feel  Love begins with a smile grows with a kiss ends with a tear When you were born you were crying and everyone around you was smiling Live your life so that when you die you're the one smiling and everyone around you is crying  The best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on a porch1 swing with never say a word and then walk away feeling like it was the best conversation you've ever had  It's true that we don't know what we've got until we lose it but it's also true that we don't know what we've been missing2 until it arrives  It takes only a minute to get a crush3 on someone an hour to like someone and a day to love someone-but it takes a lifetime to forget someone  Don't go for looks they can deceive4 Don't go for wealth even that fades away Go for someone who makes you smile because it takes only a smile to make a dark day seem bright  Don't go for looks they can deceive Don't go for wealth even that fades away Go for someone who makes you smile because it takes only a smile to make a dark day seem bright  Don't go for looks they can deceive Don't go for wealth even that fades away Go for someone who makes you smile because it takes only a smile to make a dark day seem bright  Don't go for looks they can deceive Don't go for wealth even that fades away Go for someone who makes you smile because it takes only a smile to make a dark day seem bright  Don't go for looks they can deceive Don't go for wealth even that fades away Go for someone who makes you smile because it takes only a smile to make a dark day seem bright ed to be sick myself   Just as I had forced my daughter to go to school  now I forced myself to go to the program  It seemed that it would never be time for Kristi's group to perform  When at last they did  I knew why Kristi had been worried  Her class was divided into relay teams  With her limp and slow  clumsy reactions  she would surely hold up her team  The performance went surprisingly well  though  until it was time for the gunnysack race  Now each child had to climb into a sack from a standing3 position  hop10 to a goal line  return and climb out of the sack  I watched Kristi standing near the end of her line of players  looking frantic11  But as Kristi's turn to participate neared  a change took place in her team  The tallest boy in the line stepped behind Kristi and placed his hands on her waist  Two other boys stood a little ahead of her  The moment the player in front of Kristi stepped from the sack  those two boys grabbed the sack and held it open while the tall boy lifted Kristi and dropped her neatly12 into it  A girl in front of Kristi took her hand and supported her briefly13 until Kristi gained her balance  Then off she hopped14  smiling and proud  Amid the cheers of teachers  schoolmates and parents  I crept off by myself to thank God for the warm  understanding people in life who make it possible for my disabled daughter to be like her fellow human beings  Then I finally cried
