The waterfall behind our house at the lower end of Lake Edenwold is a thundering cascade1 of spring runoff from the melting snows of winter It's been a three-week drum roll leading up to today when the cymbal2 will crash and the earth will arrive at that point in its orbit around the sun where it will be light for as many hours as it will be dark  Today is really the celestial3 climax4 to a prelude5 whose crescendo6 has been growing now for a month in the forests and lakes all around us Beginning in late February and through the month of March on my Saturday morning hikes through the lower Highlands I have watched spring slowly unfold before my eyes  A pair of hooded7 mergansers suddenly appeared on our lake earlier this month and I heard the unmistakable call of a wood duck Several thousand feet overhead an enormous migratory8 flock of Canada geese undulated like strands9 of limp black thread suspended against a steel gray sky; their wild honking10 clearly audible in spite of the flock's altitude  Just a little more than one week ago as I came to a place in the woods where the forest suddenly yields to what is a wild flower meadow in the late spring and summer the bare trees were filled with hundreds of red-winged blackbirds their cacophonous11 chatter12 filling the otherwise still morning air It was an eerie13 harbinger of spring reminiscent of the Alfred Hitchcock movie "The Birds " Later that same afternoon a small flock of cedar14 waxwings another migratory species of songbirds stopped for a rest in a nearby tree only two blocks from our house  Man has always been fascinated with the arrival of spring King Solomon weighed in on it when he wrote these words from his "Song" in the Old Testament15: "See The winter is past; the rains are over and gone Flowers appear on the earth; the season of singing has come the cooing of doves is heard in our land The fig16 tree forms its early fruit; the blossoming vines spread their fragrance17 " The arrival of spring has always marked a rebirth of sorts not just for nature but also for us humans It is a time of awakening18 a time to forget the old and to embrace the new  For most kids it's simply a time when they can play outside longer riding their new bicycles and skateboards or shooting hoops19 in driveway basketball courts For some adults it can be a serious time a release from the seasonal20 depression caused by the reduced hours of sunlight during the dark months of winter  But for most of us it is a release from the mundane21 things that after three months have added up to the point where we are all just ready for a change You know: things like having to wear layers of heavy clothing white-knuckle drives to work on icy roads and leaving home mornings in the dark only to drive back home again in darkness later the same afternoon  The crocus and daffodils will soon start peeking22 their heads above last year's pine bark nuggets and what's left of the winter snow still piled in the beds under the white pines out by the road  They are yet another prelude to the appearance of more flowers and birds: the warblers and the tanagers that will shortly appear in the trees around my home  I can't wait to inhale23 the aromas24 of things like the warming earth new mown grass and fresh piles of damp cedar mulch And I am looking forward to that first morning when I can sit outside on my deck with a cup of coffee and feel comfortable without having to don a fleece or a heavy woolen25 shirt  Whatever your passion in life take time like the busy King Solomon to pause from it for a moment over the next few weeks and just sit and watch and enjoy the spectacle of spring unfold before your eyes  And give thanks " As Patrick disappeared the pastor13 wished me a Merry Christmas but emotion choked off my reply Outside the sanctuary14 I received congratulations from fellow church members  I found my son as he emerged from the bathroom "Patrick I need to talk to you about something " I said smiling I took him by the hand and led him into a room where we could be alone I knelt to his height and admired his young face the large blue eyes the dusting of freckles15 on his nose and cheeks the dimple on one side  He looked at my moist eyes quizzically #p##e# "Patrick do you remember when you asked me why you had never seen me cry " He nodded  "Well I"m crying now " "Why Dad " "Your singing was so wonderful it made me cry " Patrick smiled proudly and flew into my arms  "Sometimes " my son said into my shoulder "life is so beautiful you have to cry " Our moment together was over too soon Untold16 treasures awaited our five-year-old beneath the tree at home but I wasn"t ready for the traditional plunge17 into Christmas just yet I handed Catherine the keys and set off for the mile-long hike home  The night was cold and crisp I crossed a park and admired the full moon hanging low over a neighborhood brightly lit in the colors of the season As I turned toward home I met a car moving slowly down the street a family taking in the area"s Christmas lights Someone rolled down a window  "Merry Christmas " a child"s voice yelled out to me  "Merry Christmas " I yelled back And the tears began to flow all over again  voice yelled out to me  "Merry Christmas " I yelled back  And the tears began to flow all over again
