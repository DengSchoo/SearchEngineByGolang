I have always believed that reading books can expand the mind touch the heart and enrich the soul They can also cause your imagination to do some funny things at times I can remember several years ago reading a book where the hero went through several tragedies and at one point in the midst of his pain and torment1 cried out: Where is Love At that moment in my imagination I leapt into the story grabbed him by the arm and told him: Its everywhere Its everywhere Love is everywhere You just have to open your heart to see it For me it is there every time I watch the dawn break upon a new day It is there every time a brisk winter breeze blows across my face It is there in the first flower of Spring It is there in the green grass of Summer It is there in the last leaf of Fall It is there every time my handicapped sons give me a hug It is there every time my daughter laughs at one of my dumb jokes It is there in the adoring eyes of my old beagle and my new puppy It is there in the purring cat that naps on my chest It is there in the smile of the clerk behind the counter It is there in the old man who opens a door for me It is there when I read a letter from a friend It is there every time I pray It is there in everything I write and every act of kindness I do The Bible tells us that God is Love And since God is without beginning or end then so is love It fills all of His creation It fills us as well every time we open our hearts and souls to it Dont shut out love then Dont live your life in pain Open your heart instead Share your love instead You will find that the more love you give away the more love you will have You will find that the more love you share the more Gods love will surround you You will find that when you live your life in love you will find love everywhere everywhere 	 	ng should really be done  	 	9 Being too frisky5 or over-affectionate 	 	Usually a by-product6 of the above getting too 'handsy' while inebriated7 or making loud slurry pronouncements of love can be seen as kind of cute or complimentary8 by some  	 	But definitely not all  	 	10 Bad clothing choices 	 	Clashing colours clothes too short too tight out of fashion inappropriate or just wrong makes us flush for obvious reasons: our partner doesn't even need to say anything to embarrass us  	 	All they need to do is stand there   the beginning of a series of gifts from the clever giver  one for each day until Christmas  Each gift followed the theme of "The Twelve Days of Christmas" in a creative way  The kids especially liked "seven swans a-swimming " which was a basket of swan-shaped soaps plus passes to the local swimming pool  giving the kids something to look forward to when the warm days of spring arrived  "Eight maids a-milking" included eight bottles of chocolate milk  eggnog and regular milk in glass bottles with paper faces  handmade aprons6 and caps  Every day was something very special  The "five golden rings" came one morning just in time for breakfast - five glazed7 doughnuts just waiting to be eaten 
	 
	We would get calls from our family  neighbors and friends who would want to know what we had received that day  Together  we would chuckle8 at the ingenuity9 and marvel10 at the thoughtfulness as we enjoyed each surprise  We were so caught up in the excitement and curiosity of what would possibly come next  that our grief didn't have much of a chance to rob us of the spirit of Christmas  What our elf did was absolutely miraculous11 
	 
	Each year since then  as we decorate our Christmas tree  we place on it the decorations we received that Christmas while we play the song "The Twelve Days of Christmas " We give thanks for our elf who was  we finally realized  our very own Christmas angel  We never did find out who it was  although we have our suspicions  We actually prefer to keep it that way  It remains12 a wondrous13 and magical experience - as mysterious and blessed as the very first Christmas        。             ，        。        ，             ，            。
	 
	What a surprise for the two merchants when they uncovered an earthen pot full of gold coins  Before breaking it  Hassan noted12 an inscription13 near the handle: "The first of seven "
	          ：              ！       ，                 ：“   ，   。”
	 
	The first of seven  That means there should be six more pots buried Jehdi understood  starting to regret the deal he had concluded too quickly 
	“       ，            。”     ，                  。
	 
	This time both of them dug with energy and  sure enough  they found the six pots  one after another  each one filled to the brim with gold coins 
	   ，        ，  ，      ，           ，         。
	 
	Hassan built a huge inn in the city and named it The Bulgy14 Pot  He lived as a rich and satisfied man until his death 
	            ，       “  ”。         ，    。
	 
	When Hassan was alive  Jehdi often came to visit him and greeted his friend with the words  "Well  Hassan  how are you  I have come to see what has happened to my dream " And then the two comrades patted each other on the back laughing  But every time Jehdi returned home sadder  for he knew that he could never buy back his dream 
	       ，        。   ，    ：“ ，  ，   ？               。”                ，   。          ，       。     ，              。
