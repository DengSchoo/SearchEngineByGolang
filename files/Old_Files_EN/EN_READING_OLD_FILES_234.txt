The tray didnt just hit the floor It crashed and smashed his lunch to pieces Serves you damn well right I thought You were staring again He stood stockstill and looked down at the food Suddenly I got up and moved towards him I hadnt intended to hadnt wanted to help him I called to the woman behind the counter She closed her mouth and brought a cloth to clean up the mess I picked up crockery put it on the tray There was a soppy stain on his trousers and through it you could see just how bony his knees were Like the rest of him All bones dangling1 jacket and hanging trousers Stooped shoulders and milelong arms Then he smiled at me A wonderful smile that creased2 up his worn face and totally surprised me Thank you I shoved the tray at him and went back to my table I worked at a large publishing company and ate lunch in the canteen I had noticed him because he stared at me He was weirdlooking His hair was badly cut and his clothes were ancient and dull; tooshort corduroys baggy3 at the knees and colourless sweaters dotted with fluff Often he sat alone and just picked at his food Or he read and jotted4 things down A few days after the crash he stopped at the table I was sharing with Mark from proof reading and asked if he might sit down I said the seats were taken and continued eating He apologised and took his tray off somewhere else Whats your problem Leanna asked Mark No problem Its just that I like to choose who I share my mealtimes with A bit rough on the old chap though I shrugged5 It was Mark who told me more about him He had gone over to scrounge a cigarette By the time he came back to the table I had my head stuck into the newspaper Interesting chap Subeditor Been all over the world said Mark I decided6 to find the newspaper more interesting and finally Mark shut up and finished smoking Asked your name he said He what Yeah Whatd you say Leanna of course I folded the newspaper Ive loads of work this afternoon Said you look familiar said Mark Like someone he knew  folded the newspaper 	 	"I've loads of work this afternoon "	 	"Said you look familiar " said Mark "Like someone he knew " have happened had he not stopped 	 	Bryan never thought twice about the money This was not a job to him This was helping9 someone in need and God knows there were plenty who had given him a hand in the past  He had lived his whole life that way and it never occurred to him to act any other way He told her that if she really wanted to pay him back the next time she saw someone who needed help she could give that person the assistance that they needed and Bryan added "  and think of me" He waited until she started her car and drove off It had been a cold and depressing day but he felt good as he headed for home disappearing into the twilight10 	 	A few miles down the road the lady saw a small cafe She went in to grab a bite to eat and take the chill off before she made the last leg of her trip home It was a dingy11 looking restaurant Outside were two old gas pumps The whole scene was unfamiliar12 to her The cash register was like the telephone of an out of work actor - it didn't ring much Her waitress came over and brought a clean towel to wipe her wet hair She had a sweet smile one that even being on her feet for the whole day couldn't erase13 The lady noticed that the waitress was nearly eight months pregnant but she never let the strain and aches change her attitude 	 	The old lady wondered how someone who had so little could be so giving to a stranger Then she remembered Bryan After the lady finished her meal and the waitress went to get change for her hundred dollar bill the lady slipped right out the door She was gone by the time the waitress came back She wondered where the lady could be then she noticed something written on the napkin under which were 4 more $100 bills There were tears in her eyes when she read what the lady wrote It said:	 	"You don't owe me anything I have been there too Somebody once helped me out the way I'm helping you If you really want to pay me back here is what you do: Do not let this chain of love end with you" 	 	Well there were tables to clear sugar bowls to fill and people to serve but the waitress made it through another day That night when she got home from work and climbed into bed she was thinking about the money and what the lady had written How could the lady have known how much she and her husband needed it With the baby due next month it was going to be hard She knew how worried her husband was and as he lay sleeping next to her she gave him a soft kiss and whispered soft and low "Everything's gonna be all right; I love you Bryan " out old journals  searching the house for mementos19  even Christmas ornaments20 he had made  There were several comforting journal excerpts21  one describing Mother"s Day phone calls from Conan to me  and a beautiful white poinsettia he gave me at Christmas  And I cherished the memories old photos brought back - his loving bear hugs after cooking his favorite meal - or a kiss for simply doing his laundry  As comforting as these things were  they still weren"t enough  One beautiful spring day  almost a year after he died  I was lovingly caressing22 the pressed rose from his grave that I kept in my Bible  Suddenly  I felt compelled to visit his grave alone  I had never done that before  but I desperately23 needed some answers  Arriving at the gravesite  I remembered Chuck mentioning that the permanent headstone had recently arrived  Chuck had told Conan"s mom to select what she wanted  As I looked down on the shiny marble surface  I noticed she had chosen a bronze sports emblem24  along with a picture of Conan that had been permanently25 embedded26 under a thick layer of glass  I bent27 down and lovingly ran my fingers over his engraved28 name and the dates commemorating29 his short life  Through a mist of tears  memories of a rambunctious30  fun-loving little boy filled my heart  The child I"d mothered part-time for so many years may not have come through my body  but I had been chosen by God to provide a maternal influence in his life  Not to take his mother"s place  but to be just a "step" away  I suddenly felt very honored to have been chosen  "It was a privilege to be your stepmother " I whispered out loud  bending to kiss his picture  Finally  a sense of peace was beginning  With a heavy sigh  I got up to leave  But as I turned to walk away  the sun glistened31 on the border of the headstone  causing me to look back  "Oh my gosh  How could I have not noticed it before " The entire border of the headstone was trimmed in gold shafts32 of wheat       exactly like a gold shaft-of-wheat pin Conan had given me years ago  Chills ran up and down my spine33  I hadn"t seen that pin in years  Somehow  I just knew it was the missing link  I had to find that pin  The ride home was a blur1  I was so excited  Finally  I was upstairs in my bedroom tearing apart my jewelry34 box  Where was it  Dumping the contents on the bed  I frantically35 tossed earrings36 and pins to and fro  Nothing  God  this is important  Please help me find it  I prayed  Turning from the bed I felt compelled to search my dresser  Rummaging37 through drawer after drawer proved futile38  until finally  in the last drawer  clear in the back I felt it  It was a small  white box with my name scribbled39 on top in a child"s handwriting  Prying40 it open  I was instantly transported back in time  Conan had been about ten years old  and it was the night before going on vacation to Florida  He was going with us  and I was packing in my room when I heard a knock on my door  Conan stood there  his eyes downcast and his hands behind his back  "What is it  son " I asked  concerned by this unexpected visit  Shuffling41 his feet  he quickly mumbled42  "I don"t know why I don"t call you "Mom" very often  even though I call my stepdad "Dad "" I hugged him and reassured him he was free to call me whatever he was comfortable with  Then suddenly  with a wry43 smile on his pudgy face  he handed me the small  white box  "You choose " he said  and darted44 from the room  Assuming I"d find two items inside the box  I opened it  Instead  I found the single gold wheat pin he"d bought at a garage sale with his own money  Scribbled inside the lid of the box were the words  "I Love You  To Mom or Connie " That had been almost a decade ago  yet as I pushed the spilled contents of my jewelry box aside and slowly sat down on the edge of the bed  it felt like yesterday  Thank you  God  for finding this pin  and for the closure that comes with it  Wiping the tears from my face  I reflected on an angelic little boy whose heart beat close to mine  I still choose "Mom "
