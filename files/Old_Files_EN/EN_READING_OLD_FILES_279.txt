Secret #1: They focus on minutes not hours  Average performers default to hours and half-hour blocks on their calendar Highly successful people know there are 1 440 minutes in every day and there is nothing more valuable than time Money can be lost and made again but time spent can never be reclaimed1 As legendary2 Olympic gymnast Shannon Miller3 told me "To this day I keep a schedule that is almost minute by minute " You must master your minutes to master your life  Secret #2: They focus only on one thing  Ultra productive people know their Most Important Task (MIT) and work on it for one to two hours each morning without interruptions Tom Ziglar CEO of Ziglar Inc shared "Invest the first part of your day working on your number one priority that will help build your business " What task will have the biggest impact on reaching your goal What accomplishment4 will get you promoted at work  Secret #3: They don't use to-do lists  Throw away your to-do list; instead schedule everything on your calendar It turns out only 41% of items on to-do lists are ever actually done And all those undone5 items lead to stress and insomnia6 because of the Zeigarnik effect Highly productive people put everything on their calendar and then work and live from that calendar "Use a calendar and schedule your entire day into 15-minute blocks It sounds like a pain but this will set you up in the 95th percentile" advises the co-founder of The Art of Charm Jordan Harbinger  Secret #4: They beat procrastination7 with time travel  Your future self can't be trusted That's because we are "time inconsistent " We buy veggies today because we think we'll eat healthy salads all week; then we throw out green rotting mush in the future I bought P90x because I think I'm going to start exercising vigorously and yet the box sits unopened one year later What can you do now to make sure your future self does the right thing Anticipate how you will self-sabotage in the future and come up with a solution to defeat your future self  Secret #5: They make it home for dinner  I first learned this from Intel's Andy Grove8 "There is always more to be done more that should be done always more than can be done " Highly successful people know what they value in life Yes work but also what else they value There is no right answer but for many values include: family time exercise giving back They consciously allocate9 their 1 440 minutes a day to each area they value (i e they put it on their calendar) and then they stick to the schedule e en parents and stepparents Instead of griping about child-support payments we voluntarily increased them And finally Conan"s mom gave us copies of his report cards and football schedules  I was proud of my kids and stepkids After graduation my stepdaughter married and she and her husband built a house together At seventeen Conan had become a sensible intelligent young man With rugged13 good looks and a deep baritone voice I wondered what fortunate girl would snatch him up  But then came that phone call changing our lives forever - Conan was killed instantly by a drunk driver  Over the years we"d been married Chuck had reassured14 me that I was a parent to his children too He sought my opinion in matters concerning them and relied on me to make their Christmases and birthdays special I enjoyed doing those things and looked upon myself as their second mother  But in his grief immediately upon Conan"s death Chuck suddenly stopped seeking my opinion and began turning to his ex-wife I knew they had to make many final decisions together and I realized later that he was trying to spare me from the gruesome details but for the first time I began to feel like an outsider instead of a parent  I also knew the driver responsible for the accident had to be prosecuted15 which meant Chuck and his ex-wife would have to stay in contact Those ugly jealousies16 from the past began to resurface when night after night he talked to her seldom discussing their conversations with me  And it stung when friends inquired only about Chuck"s coping or sent sympathy cards addressed just to him forgetting about me and even our two children Some belittled17 my grieving because I was "just" a stepparent Did anyone realize my loss and pain I"d had strong maternal feelings for Conan; he considered me his second mother - or did he As the weeks turned into months that question haunted me dominating my thoughts I became driven to understand just what my role had been #p##e# I rummaged18 through boxes of photos and dug out old journals searching the house for mementos19 even Christmas ornaments20 he had made  There were several comforting journal excerpts21 one describing Mother"s Day phone calls from Conan to me and a beautiful white poinsettia he gave me at Christmas And I cherished the memories old photos brought back - his loving bear hugs after cooking his favorite meal - or a kiss for simply doing his laundry As comforting as these things were they still weren"t enough  One beautiful spring day almost a year after he died I was lovingly caressing22 the pressed rose from his grave that I kept in my Bible Suddenly I felt compelled to visit his grave alone I had never done that before but I desperately23 needed some answers  Arriving at the gravesite I remembered Chuck mentioning that the permanent headstone had recently arrived Chuck had told Conan"s mom to select what she wanted As I looked down on the shiny marble surface I noticed she had chosen a bronze sports emblem24 along with a picture of Conan that had been permanently25 embedded26 under a thick layer of glass  I bent27 down and lovingly ran my fingers over his engraved28 name and the dates commemorating29 his short life Through a mist of tears memories of a rambunctious30 fun-loving little boy filled my heart The child I"d mothered part-time for so many years may not have come through my body but I had been chosen by God to provide a maternal influence in his life Not to take his mother"s place but to be just a "step" away I suddenly felt very honored to have been chosen  "It was a privilege to be your stepmother " I whispered out loud bending to kiss his picture  Finally a sense of peace was beginning With a heavy sigh I got up to leave But as I turned to walk away the sun glistened31 on the border of the headstone causing me to look back  "Oh my gosh How could I have not noticed it before " The entire border of the headstone was trimmed in gold shafts32 of wheat    exactly like a gold shaft-of-wheat pin Conan had given me years ago Chills ran up and down my spine33 I hadn"t seen that pin in years  Somehow I just knew it was the missing link I had to find that pin  The ride home was a blur1 I was so excited Finally I was upstairs in my bedroom tearing apart my jewelry34 box Where was it Dumping the contents on the bed I frantically35 tossed earrings36 and pins to and fro  Nothing  God this is important Please help me find it I prayed  Turning from the bed I felt compelled to search my dresser Rummaging37 through drawer after drawer proved futile38 until finally in the last drawer clear in the back I felt it It was a small white box with my name scribbled39 on top in a child"s handwriting Prying40 it open I was instantly transported back in time  Conan had been about ten years old and it was the night before going on vacation to Florida He was going with us and I was packing in my room when I heard a knock on my door Conan stood there his eyes downcast and his hands behind his back  "What is it son " I asked concerned by this unexpected visit  Shuffling41 his feet he quickly mumbled42 "I don"t know why I don"t call you "Mom" very often even though I call my stepdad "Dad "" I hugged him and reassured him he was free to call me whatever he was comfortable with Then suddenly with a wry43 smile on his pudgy face he handed me the small white box  "You choose " he said and darted44 from the room  Assuming I"d find two items inside the box I opened it Instead I found the single gold wheat pin he"d bought at a garage sale with his own money  Scribbled inside the lid of the box were the words "I Love You To Mom or Connie " That had been almost a decade ago yet as I pushed the spilled contents of my jewelry box aside and slowly sat down on the edge of the bed it felt like yesterday  Thank you God for finding this pin and for the closure that comes with it  Wiping the tears from my face I reflected on an angelic little boy whose heart beat close to mine  I still choose "Mom "
