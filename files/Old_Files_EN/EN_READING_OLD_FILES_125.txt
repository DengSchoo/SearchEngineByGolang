	To raise me in the best way that you knew how  and you still do to me that sacrifice and that dedication3 
	                ，             。
	And you gave me everything that you had  I realized how hard it was  Thank you very much 
	          。          。    。
	The discipline  the love  the support  the understanding that you gave me  I think all the thing you did for me 
	       、 、     。            。
	I look at my children  If I can just do half of what you did  they will be so much better off 
	        。              ，       。
	You were a guiding light for me  I've taken in everything that you've given me  and I run with it 
	         。            ，      。

	You always said that the reward from the hard work we've done is the opportunity to do more 
	                     。
	Well  you're right  I've done well in navy then  I get more harder work ahead of me

	And I think it could be even harder to see each other
