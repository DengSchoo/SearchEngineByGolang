I am writing this pieceafter reading a writing from a celebrity1that was encouraging young people to take their lives seriouslybetween the age of 18 and 251825because as she suggested at the age of 30 anyone must have something to show as an achievement I felt the inspiration2but I further felt an unnecessary pressureas soon as she brought the 30 years age 30I felt likeit is the root cause of some peoples depression We grasp most things that influential3 people saybecause they are our role models That is whythey need to think deeply before they do or say anything I encourage people to work hardto make positive changes in their liveswithout being made to feel ashamed of their age being made to feel ashamed of their age 	eality our minds feed us messages that range from mild embellishments to outright6 lies Here we might prefer to combat 		 	Imagine yourself in court You are the prosecutor7 and your negative thought is the defendant8 He's guilty and you know it but he's pleading not guilty and sticking to his story Your task is to get the judge to hear your side So when the negative thought shouts out "You're not good enough at your job " you need to consult the evidence you have at your disposal to prove it wrong argue back with the strongest piece of evidence you can find For example "I am good enough because every performance review I've had has been positive I'm currently being considered for that promotion9 and my boss told me last week how much she enjoys working with me " Bring your best version of a tough lawyer to that courtroom and convince the judge that the negative thought doesn't deserve his or her attentionafter all the judge is you 		 	Both of these strategies distract and combat are skills anyone can learn and get better at with practice Remember with each negative thought you defeat you've successfully earned your own happiness 	and summer of the Southern hemisphere in the light and dark greens  the autumn and winter of the Northern in the blazing yellows and bare branches 	                                                                                                                             	As I marveled at this all-encompassing beauty  I thought of Ralph Waldo Emerson's comments about the stars  If the constellations12 appeared only once in a thousand years  he observed in Nature  imagine what an exciting event it would be  But because they're up there every night  we barely give them a look 	                                                                                                                     	I felt the same way about the tree  Because its majesty13 will last only a week  it should be especially precious to us  And I had almost missed it 	                                                    	Once when Emily Dickenson's father noticed a brilliant display of northern lights in the sky over Massachusetts  he tolled14 a church bell to alert townspeople  That's what I felt like doing about the tree  I wanted to become a Paul Revere15 of autumn  awakening16 the countryside to its wonder 	                                                                                                            	I didn't have a church bell or a horse  but as I walked home  I did ask each neighbor I passed the same simple but momentous17 question Mrs  Gargan had asked me: "Have you seen the tree "ct  but the situation doesn't appear the same  Girls and boys  who burst into tears in rain now calmly let tears run down from their eyes  tell themselves they’ve got work to do tomorrow

	Nevertheless，some are willing to hold dear to love At the moment Mitsuha and Taki met with each other  tears welled from our eyes 
	  ，            。           ，      。
	 
	“What had caught my interest so much is now a mystery to me  But at a point  I was inexplicably8 drawn to the events surrounding that comet9 ”
	“             ，      ，              。”
	 
	“I feel like I am always searching for something  for someone ”
	“           ，    。”
	 
	She liked him  so her heart was hurt deeply when he went for the date that she designed 
	    ，                 ，       。
	 
	He adored10 her  so he spared no efforts to save her life when he knew she would die for the fall of the comet 
	   ，                   ，    ，       。
	 
	Sadly  although he kept repeating her name  he still forgot it 
	          ，      。
	 
	Although he failed to write down her name  the “I love you” remained on her hand  Perhaps there are bounds between people，which is hard to explain  When Taki turned around to ask Mitsuha whether they had met before  they asked at the same time ” what’s your name ” It might be a fiction story  but the feeling is true 
	               ，  “    ”       。               。                ：“         ？”      ----“     ？”         ，        。
	 
	Your Name  is cure for those who have lost faith in true love  Whenever we are overwhelmed11 by some invisible pressure  we crave12 for the love we once had  we crave for the person that we once eat dinner and watch movies together  We all need someone to share things with in our life  We are on a great journey 
	《    》                  。               ，       ，             ，     ，        ，          。           ，           ，           ，                     ，     ，     ，   ，           。
	 
	We need someone to be there for us when we are tired and want to give up  Whenever we realize that there is someone we miss so much deep inside  take a deep breath and carry on for I believe there is always a shelter for my soul  So there are plenty of strong –minded people who are brave enough to fight for love once more time  no matter what they met before or how heart-broken they were  All the seeking is for happiness  See  among all these people  we are able to find each other 
	            ，          ，          ，              。                。
	 
	For this time  I strongly believe that there will be the one who keeps searching for us from dawn to dusk To you  please believe that we must reunite in the future  even if I forget your name  One thing is certain  If we see each other  we will know
