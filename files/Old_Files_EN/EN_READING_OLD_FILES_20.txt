Raising a child is not easy and the challenges of parenthood have turned childcare advice into a multibillion pound industry Books magazines and television shows compete for credibility If your mother fed you only at the right time and ignored any cries for more she would have been applauded by Dr Frederick Truby King He was given a top honour in 1925 and credited with reducing infant mortality in New Zealand Character building was something to be started at a young age according to the stern doctor: he recommended no more than 10 minutes of cuddles a day The formative months were for eating sleeping and growing The stress on bonding was important for Dr Benjamin Spock possibly the 20th Centurys most famous childcare guru He encouraged a touchyfeely approach to bringing up children and told parents to trust their own instincts and common sense The Spock guide to parenting went mainstream1 in the 1960s when mothers were getting used to household appliances and disposable nappies It left them far more time for cuddling doting2 and pampering3 than most Truby King parents were likely to have enjoyed In Britain paediatrician and psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott helped to address some parents sense of guilt4 by promoting the idea that it was OK not to be perfect Occasional failure was not just inevitable5 it was part of the childs learning curve He didnt believe in setting regimes or even giving instructions Winnicotts philosophy was all about understanding not admonishing6 But a new technique is gaining popularity Some 21st century children have to put up with the nononsense approach of professional nanny Jo Frost This selfstyled Mary Poppins from the reality TV show Supernanny has reached millions of viewers across 47 countries For many parents Frost is the inspiration for the naughty step technique Children who are misbehaving get a warning but if they carry on they have to sit on a step After waiting one minute for every year of their age they have to apologise for what theyve done The best measure of the success of each technique might be how the baby has turned out If you are good and happy who is to say your parents method was wrong py who is to say your parents' method was wrong  fatigue9 as he bathed him everyday  did him passive exercises  put him on his potty  took him to bed and everything that I  myself  should be doing as the nurse of the family 	Instead  I blamed him for bringing curse into the family for his stubbornness   	I blamed him for the financial difficulties I was suffering for many years  	I was just too blind and deaf to see that he was not an evil after all 	That he had the character every parents would dream in a child  	A child that would take care of them when they get old and sick 	I was not able to sleep well that night  	I was so overwhelmed with the fact that it is not him that has been wrong all the time  but me and my wicked heart trus-blackberry scent3. In the opening  I get only a small whiff of the bay leaf and then it's tart4 and kinda sour. As it's mellowing5  the blackberry starts coming through  followed by grapefruit nuances.

	I love a lot of Jo Malone fragrances7, but I probably won't purchase this one. Longevity8 is very weak, plus I like my blackberry fragrances a bit on the warmer side. For me, it's not worth the price tag as there are better blackberry perfumes out there. If you're a die-hard Jo Malone fan, then go for it.
