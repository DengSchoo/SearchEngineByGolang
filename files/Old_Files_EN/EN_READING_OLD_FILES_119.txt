10 Its better than thinking about it Thinking about something before you do it is a great trait to have But thinking can also be dangerous when you do too much of it You can think as much as you like but thinking isnt going to change the situation In fact thinking isnt going to change anything Thinking will just keep you in the same position youre already in You wont go anywhere as If youre a human statue 9 Too much thinking can become a bad habit Whatever you do everyday is a habit and thats a fact Unfortunately that means too much thinking can also become a habit And Its not a habit thats going to push you forward and get you started Its about time to woke up and got started or else you never will 8 Its better than never taking action Do you want to be the man or the woman who never does anything Do you want to be the man or the woman who never gets started Take action and get out of your own head You wont regret it 7 Its better than dreaming about doing it How long are you going to dream about starting your own business How long are you going to dream about getting started How long are you going to dream about how wonderful itll be when you DO take action And how long are you going to dream about how much of a difference itll make to your life Theres only so much dreaming you can do before you have to turn that dream into action A dream without action is a fantasy destined1 to never come true 6 Youve got to get over your fear of starting eventually Have no fear of perfection youll never reach it  Salvador Dali Maybe thats the reason why youve yet to get started up until this point Are you afraid What are you so afraid of anyway Is it rejection2 Being turned down Things not going the way you expect them to Are you afraid of failure Do you fear being criticized Humiliation3 Losing money Lack of support Whatever your fears might be its time to get over it If theres one thing Ive learned about facing your fears its the fact that fear is never as bad as we believe it to be 5 Its better than over analyzing4 what you want to do You know what happens when you start over analyzing something You stress yourself out You wear yourself out you worry you over think you make stuff up in your head and you over exaggerate What an imagination our brains have But seriously speaking theres only so much analyzing you can do At some point youre going to have to kick your ass5 into gear At some point youll have to put the key in the ignition start the engine and push the pedal You cant do that with your mind 4 Procrastinating6 wont get you anywhere Getting started is easy simple and doable Yet procrastinating is also easy to do Ironic7 isnt it But the truth is delaying what youve been dying to do isnt going to benefit you At best itll hinder you in more ways than one Remember what I said earlier about what we do everyday is a habit Well If you procrastinate8 enough that habit will creep into other parts of your life as well If you procrastinate with simple things youll procrastinate with harder things One leads to another Start small If you must but at the least you need to get started 3 The last thing you want to do is regret not starting Regretting what youve done is one thing but regretting what youve never done is another Lets be honest regretting what you havent done is so much worse Especially when its something youre adamant9 to do You dont want to be that person who regrets it 30 years from now do you 2 You can adjust your actions along the way Ready aim fire Youve heard of the saying right Well what happens if you spend all your time aiming and not firing Youll never hit anything Thats basically what youre doing by thinking too much and not getting started Ready fire aim should be your approach You might not get it right on the first shot but you can adjust your aim as you go along Its better to make a mistake than do nothing at all This ties in with the last point I just made I dont like to make mistakes you dont like to mistakes nobody likes to make mistakes But nobodys perfect so its impossible not to make a mistake As great as computers and smartphones are even they can make mistakes You cant get away from it And thats OK Just be sure to get started on whatever youve been delaying for so long And when you do make a mistake learn from it and get it right the next time Then youll be way ahead I can guarantee you that o long And when you do make a mistake learn from it and get it right the next time Then you'll be way ahead I can guarantee you that t
