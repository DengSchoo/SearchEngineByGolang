Sing to yourself  Seriously Like laughter sunshine and fresh air; singing elevates our moods Studies have shown that singing triggers a release of endorphins which are the body's natural way of chemically relieving pain and stress When we're happier we get more done This might be why Snow White likes to whistle while she works  Visualize1 your success  It is a simple but useful motivational technique because when you form a picture of succeeding in your mind you begin to see the possibility of reaching your goal   Keep a goal diary  Writing down your goals and reflecting regularly on their progress helps you to both focus on the desired outcome and holds you accountable While financial stability is only one quantifiable way to measure success   Find a "study buddy2" While this can be a useful way to motivate students to complete homework it can also work well for anyone who has a hard time settling down to work While this might not work for everyone I've always found that glancing up now and then to make a comment about something I've read does more than allow for a break in the action   Daydream  Like the other visualization3 techniques we've talked about this practice keeps your eye on the prize and it's a conscious form of procrastination4 unless you meet that deadline which inevitably5 forces your mind back on work lpful This prayer is a prayer you can use repeatedly for cleansing8 in this manner  Not only must we forgive others but forgiveness in our own mind regarding our impression of others and how they might judge US is also important I believe forgiving our own self is equally important in the forgiveness process Marcus Porcious Cato said "I can pardon everyone's mistakes but my own " This is too true for most of us Yet we must release our mistakes (dust garbage in our spiritual self ) too in order to move forward clearly  In forgiving others and forgiving our own self we can truly be free and clear to build the life we want It is sometimes said "to err9 is human; to forgive unusual " We can take the "unusual" path and become truly unusual people Unusual people discover their purpose and live it each day te time beating yourself up because your plans didn't go the way you wanted  Don't worry about things you can't change; focus on making new plans/goals and where you will go from here 
Time Is a Limited Resource Nothing lasts forever  Enjoy every moment that you have  Enjoy life and practice being present in the moment because it goes by extremely fast  There will be both good and bad times  The bad thing about up is there's always a down  It's important to really enjoy and savor10 the good moments in life because you'll need those memories to reflect back on when the bad times come  The first 10 years after high school go by at a breakneck speed and before you know it you're 28 and wondering how the time has escaped you
