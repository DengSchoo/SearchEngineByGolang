In Chinese culture how common is it to regularly say I love you I cant remember a single time that my parents explicitly1 told me I love you However I can clearly remember the day I talked to my dad about King Lear I told him about how sorry I felt for Lear because he was betrayed by his daughters Goneril and Regan Lear knowing that he was getting old decided2 to split his kingdom among his 3 girls He proclaimed that he would give the greatest share to the one who loved him most So Goneril and Regan proceed to deceive their father with lavish3 expressions of love Meanwhile the third daughter Cordelia refuses to participate in such false displays She loves her father too much and she doesnt want to degrade herself to the level of her sisters Instead she says in an aside: Then poor Cordelia And yet not so; since I am sure my loves more richer than my tongue Lear is deeply offended and in a cruel twist of irony4 disinherits the only child who truly loved him Sadly he later gets kicked out of his own kingdom by the two daughters who claimed to adore him more than anything in the world My fathers response to my retelling of the story was approximately the following:Thats why you dont need to say I love you Just saying I love youdoesnt necessarily mean your love is real But if you really love someone youll show it with your actions So although I never heard the words I love you from my parents I always felt loved because they told me in ways that speak much louder than words I think many other Chinese feel the same way s I think many other Chinese feel the same way speak with melody5 and intonation to our voice  you take that channel of information out of communication  you lose another way that sense is being conveyed "	 	Of course texting and talking is the worst thing to do  Who deserves your attention when two people are communicating with you  It's then we have to decide who has the most interesting thing to say 
	 
	Finally Indigo9 spoke  much more quietly than all the others  but with just as much determination:" Think of me  I am the color of silence  You hardly notice me  but without me you all become superficial  I represent thought and reflection  twilight10 and deep water  You need me for balance and contrast  for prayer and inner peace "
	 
	And so the colors went on boasting  each convinced of his or her own superiority  Their quarreling became louder and louder 
	 
	Suddenly there was a startling flash of bright lightening thunder rolled and boomed  Rain started to pour down relentlessly11  The colors crouched12 down in fear  drawing close to one another for comfort 
	 
	In the midst of the clamor  rain began to speak:" You foolish colors  fighting amongst yourselves  each trying to dominate the rest  Don't you know that you were each made for a special purpose  unique and different  Join hands with one another and come to me "
	 
	Doing as they were told  the colors united and joined hands 
	 
	The rain continued:" From now on  when it rains  each of you will stretch across the sky in a great bow of color as a reminder13 that you can all live in peace  The Rainbow is a sign of hope for tomorrow " And so  whenever a good rain washes the world  and a Rainbow appears in the sky  let us remember to appreciate one another
