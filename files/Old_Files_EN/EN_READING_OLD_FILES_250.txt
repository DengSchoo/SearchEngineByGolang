	In the eternal universe every human being has a one-off chance to live --his existence is unique and irretrievable for the mold with which he was made as Rousseau said was broken by God immediately afterwards 	 	Fame wealth and knowledge are merely worldly possessions that are within the reach of anybody striving for them But your experience of and feelings about life are your own and not to be shared No one can live your life over again after your death A full awareness1 of this will point out to you that the most important thing in your existence is your distinctive2 individuality or something special of yours What really counts is not your worldly success but your peculiar3 insight into the meaning of life and your commitment to it which add luster4 to your personality 	 	It is not easy to be what one really is There is many a person in the world who can be identified as anything either his job his status or his social role that shows no trace about his individuality It does do him justice to say that he has no identity of his own if he doesn't know his own mind and all his things are either arranged by others or done on others' sugg estions; if his life always occupied by external things is completely void of an inner world You won't be able to find anything whatever from head to heart that truly belongs to him He is indeed no more than a shadow cast by somebody else or a machine capable of doing business h fear from our minds Fear is the concern over events that might happen in the future -- we won' t have enough money our children will get into trouble we will get old and die whatever  To combat fear the best strategy is to learn to bring your attention back to the present Mark Twain said 'I have been through some terrible things in my life some of which actually happened I don't think I can say it any better Practice keeping your attention on the here and now Your efforts will pay great dividends9  sportation but also don't have time to

They went to movies and meals and often got together with mutual10 friends They alternated paying the dinner check "He was like a girlfriend " my roommate once laughed-blushing Men and women relax and get to know each other more easily through such friendships Another friends of mine believes that casual dating is improving people's social lives When she wants to let a guy know she is interested she'll say "Hey let's go get a yogurt "	 	Who pays for it My past dates have taught me some things You don't know if I'll get the wrong idea if you treat me for dinner and I don't know if I'll deny your pleasure or offend you by insisting on paying for myself John whipped out his wallet on our first date before I could suggest we go Dutch During our after-dinner stroll he told me he was interested in dating me on a steady basis After I explained I was more interested in a friendship he told me he would have understood has I paid for my dinner "I've practically stopped treating women on dates " he said defensively "It's safer and more comfortable when we each pay for ourselves " John has assumed that because I graciously accepted his treat I was in love He was mad at himself for treating me and I regretted allowing him to 	 	Larry on the other hand blushed when I offered to pay for my meal on our first date I unzipped my purse and flung out my wallet and he looked at me as if I had addressed him in a foreign language Hesitant I asked politely "How much do I owe you " Larry muttered "Uh uh you really don't owe me anything but if you insist"	 	Insist I though I only offered To Larry my gesture was a suggestion of rejection11 	 	Men and women alike are confused about who should ask whom out and who should pay While I treasure my femininity adore gentlemen and delight in a traditional formal date I also believe in equality I am grateful for casual dating because it has improved my social life immensely by making me an active participant in the process Now I can not only receive roses but can also give them Casual dating is a worthwhile adventure because it works No magic formula guarantees "he" will say yes I just have to relax be Laura and ask him out in an unthreatening manner If my friends are right he'll be flattered 	 	Sliding into his desk he taps my shoulder and says "Hi Laura what's up "	 	"Good morning " I answer with nervous chills "Hey how would you like to have lunch after class on Friday "	 	"You mean after the midterm " he says encouragingly "I'd love to go to lunch with you "	 	"We have a date " I smile of a sudden I wanted to see him  talk to him  hear his voice  I wondered why I felt that way  The next day was the day of the prom  I woke up that morning feeling nervous  I could've cared less about the dance  it was where I was going afterwards that I was thinking of  The decorations at the dance were beautiful  The music was great  But I couldn't enjoy myself  I was restless up until I left at 11:45  I began walking towards the park  Although it was May  it was a cool evening  A breeze stirred the branches of the trees  I wrapped my jacket tight around me  Then I spotted16 a small park bench where I decided to wait  Thirty minutes passed and he still hadn't arrived  Maybe no one was coming in the first place  I thought  maybe he doesn't exist  I let a few tears slip out  then told myself I wouldn t cry  Just then I got a call on my cell phone from Christy  She sounded upset  "Marly " she shouted  "Jimmy McAllister was in an accident by the school  He's hurt really bad " "Oh my God " I exclaimed

rose was a card that read  'for Marly '
