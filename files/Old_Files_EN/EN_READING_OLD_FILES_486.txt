You spend years trying to get them off the ground  You run with them until you're both breathless  They crash  They hit the rooftop  You patch comfort and sure that someday they would fly Finally they are airborne  They need more string and you keep letting it out  They talk and the each twist of the twine1 there is a sadness that goes with joy  The kite becomes more distant  and you know it won't be long before that beautiful creature will snap the lifeline that binds2 you two together and will soar as it is meant to soar free and alone  Only then do you know that you did your job  why  Ultimately you feel like you are wandering through life without purpose  It donesn't take much to bring on a blue day  You might just wake up not feeling or looking your best  find some new wrinkles  put on a little weight  or get a huge pimple8 on your nose  You could forget your date's name or have an embarrassing photograph published  You might get dumped  divorced or fired  make fool of yourself in public  be afflicted9 with a demeaning nickname  or just have a plain old bad-hair day  Maybe work is a pain in the butt10  You're under major pressure to fill someone else's shoes  your boss is picking on you  and everyone in the office is driving you crazy  Whatever the reason  you're convinced that someone up there doesn't like you  Oh what to do  what to do  Well  if you're like most people  you'll hide behind a flimsy belief that everything will sort itself out  Then you will spend the rest of your life looking over your shoulder  waiting for everything to go wrong all over again  All the while becoming crusty and cynical11 or a pathetic  sniveling victim  Until you get so depressed12 that you lie down and beg the earth to swallow you up or  even worse  become addicted13 to Billy Joel songs  This is crazy  because you're only young once and you're never old twice  Now just relax  Take some deep breaths  Try to meditate14 if you can  Or go for a walk to clear your head  Accept the fact that you'll have to go of some emotional baggage  Never hang back  Get out there and go for it  After all  isn't that what life is all about
