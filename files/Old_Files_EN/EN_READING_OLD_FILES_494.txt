A dream is to a man what wings are to a bird With a dream in the deep heart's core a man is spontaneously driven to hitch1 his wagon2 to a star A dream is an inexhaustible source of energy that keeps our enthusiasm burning and kindles3 our desire to enhance our spiritual cultivation4 refine our character and upgrade our quality of life A life without a dream is like a bird with broken wings confined to a cage and oblivious5 of what lies beyond the range of its vision On the contrary a man with a dream is like a warrior6 armed with ambition foresight7 and gallantry daring to step into an unknown domain8 to make a journey of adventure It is dream that adds fullness variety and spice to our life and makes it worth living  I have a dream It is d dream that is deeply rooted in human nature I dream that one day people of all origins can live in harmony and peace without being discriminated9 against or persecuted10 The bounty11 of the earth can be shared by every single human being Mutual12 respect will guarantee the existence and continuation of the diversity of customs and cultures Love sympathy and cooperation will alleviate13 the sufferings and disasters inflicted14 upon our fellow men Respect for basic human rights will put an end to social injustices15 and evils When my dream comes true all men will be truly equal happy and free avily influenced by our beliefs and past experiences  Our subconscious8 mind chooses pieces of information to serve to our conscious mind based on what we've programmed it to look for  Identify your dominant9 beliefs and replace the ones that aren't serving you  Meditation10 is something people do on a cushion at sunrise  You can meditate11 and be mindful all throughout the day as you go about your life  Pause and feel the weight of your body in your seat  the feeling of the fabric12 against your skin  and the slight sensation of the air on your face  Take a few deep breaths and let your whole being relax  Scan your body up and down for sensations  simply observing  without making any judgments13  When we give something  we lose something  Giving and receiving are one in truth  When you give to someone with no strings14 attached -- whether it be a physical gift  a compliment or your time -- you are nourished as well as the receiver  Not only do you experience sensations of satisfaction and joy  but your karma will bring more blessings15 and gifts back into your life  We have to logically figure everything out  We've been taught to trust our minds but not our intuition or inner voice of guidance  When you're grappling with a problem or lacking clarity  learn to lean into your soul and trust the wisdom it provides to you -- often in the form of a gut16 feeling  serendipitous17 sign or a spontaneous "aha " moment  We need to be more realistic  Many people think that daily happiness and joy is an unrealistic goal  and we should be more realistic  Happiness is THE ultimate goal of our lives  and it is both worthwhile and attainable18  Understand your purpose is to blossom into the highest  happiest version of you and let go of any guilt19 you feel for making your happiness a priority
