Spring is coming spring is coming  Birdies build your nest; Weave together straw and feather  Doing each your best  Spring is coming spring is coming  Flowers are coming too: Pansies lilies daffodillies  Now are coming thought Spring is coming spring is coming  All around is fair  Shimmer1 and quiver on the river  Joy is everywhere error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows the great enthusiasms the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy3 cause who at the best knows in the end the triumphs of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least fails whiledaring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat e more by humoring that superstition2 than you can by acting3 on your own better judgment4  Be respectful to your superiors  if you have any  also to strangers  and sometimes to others  If a person offend you  and you are in doubt as to whether it was intentional5 or not  do not resort to extreme measures; simply watch your chance and hit him with a brick  That will be sufficient  If you shall find that he had not intended any offense6  come out frankly7 and confess yourself in the wrong when you struck him; acknowledge it like a man and say you didn't mean to  Yes  always avoid violence; in this age of charity and kindliness8  the time has gone by for such things  Leave dynamite9 to the low and unrefined  Go to bed early  get up early- this is wise  Some authorities say get up with the sun; some say get up with one thing  others with another  But a lark10 is really the best thing to get up with  It gives you a splendid reputation with everybody to know that you get up with the lark; and if you get the right kind of lark  and work at him right  you can easily train him to get up at half past nine  every time -- it's no trick at all
