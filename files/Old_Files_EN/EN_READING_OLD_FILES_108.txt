As a man was passing the elephants he suddenly stopped confused1 by the fact that these huge creatures were being held by only a small rope tied to their front leg No chains no cages It was obvious that the elephants could at anytime break away from their bonds2 but for some reason they did not He saw a trainer nearby and asked why these animals just stood there and made no attempt to get away Well trainer said when they are very young and much smaller we use the same size rope to tie them and at that age its enough to hold them As they grow up they are conditioned to believe they cannot break away They believe the rope can still hold them so they never try to break free The man was amazed3 These animals could at any time break free from their bonds but because they believed they couldnt they were stuck right where they were Like the elephants how many of us go through life hanging onto a belief that we cannot do something simply because we failed at it once before Failure is part of learning4; we should never give up the struggle in life up the struggle in life  work thought to have artistic3 merit that has the best effect He told the BBC that when reading something for pleasure "the brain begins to work from different parts from a different hemisphere and it gets excited it gets pre-emotional  and you can see the brain coming to life "	 	Of course it's easy in our smartphone generation to ditch a good book and fiddle4 with our phones instead But opening up a paperback5 could be a simple way to help boost or maintain our mental health It's thought they can help you set targets and find focus And they may allow you see that awkward situation you've been anxious about for weeks from someone else's perspective 	 	If you're not an avid6 reader it can be hard to know where to begin If the Reading Agency book list doesn't appeal you could to read book reviews visit a library or bookshop or ask a friend Once you've found the right text you'll be hooked And if you still love your technology you could always use an e-reader ng your fears  it's the fact that fear is never as bad as we believe it to be 
	 
	5 It's better than over analyzing4 what you want to do 
	 
	You know what happens when you start over analyzing something  You stress yourself out  You wear yourself out  you worry  you over think  you make stuff up in your head  and you over exaggerate  What an imagination our brains have  But seriously speaking  there's only so much analyzing you can do  At some point you're going to have to kick your ass5 into gear  At some point you'll have to put the key in the ignition  start the engine  and push the pedal  You can't do that with your mind 
	 
	4 Procrastinating6 won't get you anywhere 
	 
	Getting started is easy  simple  and doable  Yet procrastinating is also easy to do  Ironic7 isn't it  But the truth is  delaying what you've been dying to do isn't going to benefit you  At best  it'll hinder you in more ways than one  Remember what I said earlier about what we do everyday is a habit  Well If you procrastinate8 enough  that habit will creep into other parts of your life as well  If you procrastinate with simple things  you'll procrastinate with harder things  One leads to another  Start small If you must  but at the least you need to get started 
	 
	3 The last thing you want to do is regret not starting 
	 
	Regretting what you've done is one thing  but regretting what you've never done is another  Lets be honest  regretting what you haven't done is so much worse  Especially when it's something you're adamant9 to do  You don't want to be that person who regrets it 30 years from now  do you 
	 
	2 You can adjust your actions along the way 
	 
	Ready  aim  fire  You've heard of the saying  right  Well what happens if you spend all your time aiming  and not firing  You'll never hit anything  That's basically what you're doing by thinking too much and not getting started  Ready  fire  aim should be your approach  You might not get it right on the first shot  but you can adjust your aim as you go along 
	 
	It's better to make a mistake than do nothing at all 
	 
	This ties in with the last point I just made  I don't like to make mistakes  you don't like to mistakes  nobody likes to make mistakes  But nobody's perfect so it's impossible not to make a mistake  As great as computers and smartphones are  even they can make mistakes  You can't get away from it  And that's OK  Just be sure to get started on whatever you've been delaying for so long  And when you do make a mistake  learn from it and get it right the next time  Then you'll be way ahead  I can guarantee you that
