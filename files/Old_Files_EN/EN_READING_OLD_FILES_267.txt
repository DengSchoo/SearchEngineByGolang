My brother-in-law opened the bottom drawer of my sister's bureau and lifted out a tissue-wrapped package "This " he said "is not a slip This is lingerie " He discarded the tissue and handed me the slip It was exquisite1; silk handmade and trimmed with a cobweb of lace The price tag with an astronomical2 figure on it was still attached "Jan bought this the first time we went to New York at least 8 or 9 years ago She never wore it She was saving it for a special occasion Well I guess this is the occasion " He took the slip from me and put it on the bed with the other clothes we were taking to the mortician His hands lingered on the soft material for a moment then he slammed the drawer shut and turned to me "Don't ever save anything for a special occasion Every day you're alive is a special occasion " I remembered those words through the funeral and the days that followed when I helped him and my niece attend to all the sad chores that follow an unexpected death I thought about them on the plane returning to California from the Midwestern town where my sister's family lives I thought about all the things that she hadn't seen or heard or done I thought about the things that she had done without realizing that they were special  I'm still thinking about his words and they've changed my life I'm reading more and dusting less I'm sitting on the deck and admiring the view without fussing about the weeds in the garden I'm spending more time with my family and friends and less time in committee meetings Whenever possible life should be a pattern of experience to savor3 not endure I'm trying to recognize these moments now and cherish them  I'm not "saving" anything we use our good china and crystal for every special event-such as losing a pound getting the sink unstopped the first camellia blossom I wear my good blazer to the market if I feel like it My theory is if I look prosperous I can shell out $28 49 for one small bag of groceries without wincing4 I'm not saving my good perfume for special parties; clerks in hardware stores and tellers5 in banks have noses that function as well as my party-going friends'  "Someday" and "one of these days" are losing their grip on my vocabulary If it's worth seeing hearing or doing I want to see and hear and do it now I'm not sure what my sister would have done had she known that she wouldn't be here for the tomorrow we all take for granted I think she would have called family members and a few close friends She might have called a few former friends to apologize and mend fences for past squabbles I like to think she would have gone out for a Chinese dinner her favorite food I'm guessing--I'll never know  It's those little things left undone6 that would make me angry if I knew that my hours were limited Angry because I put off seeing good friends whom I was going to get in touch with "someday " Angry because I hadn't written certain letters that I intended to write--one of these days Angry and sorry that I didn't tell my husband and daughter often enough how much I truly love them  I'm trying very hard not to put off hold back or save anything that would add laughter and luster7 to our lives  And every morning when I open my eyes I tell myself that it is special Every day every minute every breath truly is  a gift from God d   Author: George Orwell # of sold copies: 25 million First edition:1949 History has shown us that mankind is capable of both terrible and good things and it's a matter of conscience which side prevails  George Orwell took the liberty to tell us how what the world look like if despotic and oppressive regimes took the upper hand  In the imaginary year 1984 the Earth is divided among three major nations which constantly wage war against each other  The main character named Winston Smith lives in Oceania ruled by one party - called The Party  Everything is scarce  basic human right and emotions are constantly being twisted and above all  The Big Brother is always watching  Although 1984 is quite gloomy and despairing  we have to acknowledge that it's still in our "grasp" to create such a scenario10  It needed to be said out loud in order to realize how absurd and sick such totalitarian practices are
