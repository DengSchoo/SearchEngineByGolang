If you have ever been discouraged because of failure please read on For often achieving what you set out to do is not the important thing Let me explain Two brothers decided1 to dig a deep hole behind their house As they were working a couple of older boys stopped by to watch What are you doing asked one of the visitors We plan to dig a hole all the way through the earth one of the brothers volunteered excitedly The older boys began to laugh telling the younger ones that digging a hole all the way through the earth was impossible After a long silence one of the diggers picked up a jar full of spiders worms and a wide assortment2 of insects He removed the lid and showed the wonderful contents to the scoffing3 visitors Then he said quietly and confidently Even if we dont dig all the way through the earth look what we found along the way Their goal was far too ambitious4 but it did cause them to dig And that is what a goal is forto cause us to move in the direction we have chosen; in other words to set us to digging But not every goal will be fully5 achieved Not every job will end successfully Not every relationship will endure6 Not every hope will come to pass Not every love will last Not every endeavor7 will be completed Not every dream will be realized But when you fall short of your aim perhaps you can say Yes but look at what I found along the way Look at the wonderful things which have come into my life because I tried to do something It is in the digging that life is lived And I believe it is joy in the journey in the end that truly matters e it is joy in the journey in the end that truly matters ve your surroundings6 to make the planet a better place to live in Always remember that every step every initiative7 counts  	 	The future of our planet is in your hands dominates the photo  In it a woman - my mother - reclines  Mom is spread out in the chair like thick  sweet frosting on a cake  Languid  her arms raised above her head  her legs splayed  pant legs rolled up to expose a goodly length of pale skin  Her arms are bare  the undersides pasty in comparison to the tops  Her smile in repose16 is tender  sweet  unassuming  and peaceful 	 	To my knowledge  Mom never owned a bathing suit  I don't recall ever seeing her step into the lake  and never before had she sunbathed17  That day  however  was different  It was as if all her cares had floated out to deep waters like the unattended beach ball had done just minutes before 	 	We are a large family  When my siblings18 and I were young  Dad was the one who took us to the beach  He sat in the car and watched as we frolicked in the shallows  Mom stayed home to ensure we had a hot meal when we returned  Perhaps Mom was happy for the few moments of alone time at home in the kitchen  as was Dad  alone in the car 	 	On this day  their grown children  with children of our own  treat them to dinner on the beach  Dad fishes off the dock  never swaying from his pleasantries  And  for once  Mom forgets about making dinner 	 	It is a day of memories  a day never to be forgotten 	 	My three children are in the photo  and Dad is in the background  as are two of my sisters and their children  but everyone who gazes at the poorly developed photo is drawn19 inexplicably20 to Mom's smile  In the photo  her face is raised up to the sky  To the sun or to our Creator  she alone knows  Her eyes are closed 	 	I remember how warm it was that day and how she had squinted21 up at me  shielding her eyes with both hands 	 	"Are my legs getting red " she'd asked 	 	My eyes brim with unshed tears as I remember the feel of her skin on the palm of my hand  Hot  The scalding tears run down my face  How I wish I could touch her one more time 	 	"No  Mom " I replied  "But better put some sunscreen on before you get a burn " Reluctantly  she'd sat up  the peaceful smile disappearing  and rolled her pant legs down  again 	 	"Save it for the kids " she said  her eyes scanning the group of children splashing in and out of the water  The whisper of a smile touched her lips as she watched for a long  wistful moment  With a sigh  she rose from the chair and moved toward the car where the coolers awaited 	 	"Maybe we should get lunch going " she said as she opened the first cooler 	 	Now it is my turn to smile  Mom was not ready to relinquish22 dinner duties  after all  On a whim23  I turn my face heavenward and close my eyes  I draw a deep breath and search for the special place Mom found that afternoon  It comes to me easily  Without pomp or ceremony  there she is  smiling again  Tears squeeze from beneath my closed lids  and I fervently24 pray that anyone who might come upon me at this moment will say my smile reminds them of Mom's smile  that day on the beach so long ago  Tender  sweet  unassuming - and despite our loss it was peaceful t it does matter  My father and I loved each other  Yet  I always regretted never hearing him put his feelings into words and never having the memory of that moment  Now  I could feel my palms sweat and my throat tighten14  Why is it so hard to tell a son something from the heart  My mouth turned dry  and I knew I would be able to get out only a few words clearly 
	 
	"Daniel " I said  "if I could have picked  I would have picked you "
	 
	That's all I could say  I wasn't sure he understood what I meant  Then he came toward me and threw his arms around me  For a moment  the world and all its people vanished  and there was just Daniel and me in our home by the sea 
	 
	He was saying something  but my eyes misted over  and I couldn't understand what he was saying  All I was aware of was the stubble on his chin as his face pressed against mine  And then  the moment ended  I went to work  and Daniel left a few hours later with his girlfriend 
	 
	That was seven weeks ago  and I think about him when I walk along the beach on weekends  Thousands of miles away  somewhere out past the ocean waves breaking on the deserted15 shore  he might be scurrying16 across Boulevard Saint Germain  strolling through a musty hallway of the Louvre  bending an elbow in a Left Bank café 
	 
	What I had said to Daniel was clumsy and trite17  It was nothing  And yet  it was everything
