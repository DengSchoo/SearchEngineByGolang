	"You don't owe me anything  I have been there too  Somebody once helped me out  the way I'm helping you  If you really want to pay me back  here is what you do: Do not let this chain of love end with you" 
	 
	Well  there were tables to clear  sugar bowls to fill  and people to serve  but the waitress made it through another day  That night when she got home from work and climbed into bed  she was thinking about the money and what the lady had written  How could the lady have known how much she and her husband needed it  With the baby due next month  it was going to be hard  She knew how worried her husband was  and as he lay sleeping next to her  she gave him a soft kiss and whispered soft and low  "Everything's gonna be all right; I love you  Bryan "
