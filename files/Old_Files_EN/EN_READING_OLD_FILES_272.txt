1 Head bumps and leg rubs Cats have scent1 glands2 concentrated on certain parts of their bodies including their cheeks and heads When your kitty rubs her head or face against you she's marking you with her scent and claiming you as part of her family group This scent is a source of both comfort and familiarity for your kitty 2 Grooming3 sessions Grooming is another way that cats spread their scent to mark territory If you have multiple cats you may have seen them grooming each other a social practice cats use to establish a common scent among the family group By sharing a scent your feline4 friend is creating a sense of belonging 3 Slow blinks When your kitty looks at you and slowly closes his eyes he's showing that he's content and comfortable around you In fact this slow-blinkingbehavior has even earned the nickname kitty kisses  "The concept of closing their eyes to you in a slow way is not something that they would do " says cat behaviorist Jackson Galaxy5 "They're letting you know that they are vulnerable to you "4 Exposing the belly6 Another way cats can show that vulnerability is by rolling over and exposing their bellies7 This is a sure sign of trust and shows that your cat is comfortable around you  5 Kneading When kitties knead your lap or a surface near you it means they're relaxed and content As kittens the behavior is used to stimulate8 a mother's milk flow but continuing the action into adulthood9 can express comfort  6 Kitty underfoot If your feline friend follows you from room to room jumps onto tables and counters to be near you and always seems to be right where your step she clearly enjoys your company -- especially if it's not near feeding time  7 Tail position How your cat holds her tail can tell you a lot about how she's feeling A tail held straight in the air is often used as a greeting so you know your kitty is happy to see you In fact Dr John Bradshaw author of the book "Cat Sense " says this is "probably the clearest way cats show their affection for us " A tail held upright with a curve at the tip like a question mark also indicates familiarity friendliness10 and affection  8 Purring While a cat's purr isn't an always indication of love and happiness cats also purr when they're scared or injured -- a happy cat may express affection by purring when he's curled up in your lap or rubbing against your leg  ts he touches her hair kisses her cheek sits in the orange plastic chair at the side of her bed and holds her hand Like my own father he has the big brown life-roughened hands of a fisherman He too smells of the sea and pretends he is a good simple man  Jasmine We share so much we are almost one  I remember early mornings my hair touched to wake me my father lifting me half-asleep from my bed carrying me dropping me into his boat His voice rough in my ear his hands rough on my skin I never wanted to go but I was just a child He did as he wished  I remember salt water hot sun my mother shrinking on the shore I remember the rocking of the boat the screams of the gulls11  'Jasmine you have a life inside you Can't you hear it calling ' Nothing  The ward door bangs and I see Jasmine's father walking towards us carrying flowers He smiles at me  Even in death my own child had my father's smile and Jasmine's will have this man's I know it  He stops by her bed and touches her hair Something stirs deep inside me I watch Jasmine's eyelids12 waiting for her to bite en him his sleeping draught9  he would have slept soundly enough " When they were all ready  they went and looked at the soldier; but he snored on  and did not stir hand or foot: so they thought they were quite safe  Then the eldest went up to her own bed and clapped her hands  and the bed sank into the floor and a trap-door flew open  The soldier saw them going down through the trap-door one after another  the eldest leading the way; and thinking he had no time to lose  he jumped up  put on the cloak which the old woman had given him  and followed them  However  in the middle of the stairs he trod10 on the gown of the youngest princess  and she cried out to her sisters  "All is not right; someone took hold of my gown " "You silly creature " said the eldest  "it is nothing but a nail in the wall " Down they all went  and at the bottom they found themselves in a most delightful11 grove12 of trees; and the leaves were all of silver  and glittered13 and sparkled14 beautifully  The soldier wished to take away some token15 of the place; so he broke off a little branch  and there came a loud noise from the tree  Then the youngest daughter said again  "I am sure all is not right -- did not you hear that noise  That never happened before "#p#    #e# But the eldest said  "It is only our princes  who are shouting for joy at our approach " They came to another grove of trees  where all the leaves were of gold; and afterwards to a third  where the leaves were all glittering16 diamonds  And the soldier broke a branch from each; and every time there was a loud noise  which made the youngest sister tremble with fear  But the eldest still said it was only the princes  who were crying for joy  They went on till they came to a great lake; and at the side of the lake there lay twelve little boats with twelve handsome princes in them  who seemed to be waiting there for the princesses  One of the princesses went into each boat  and the soldier stepped into the same boat as the youngest  As they were rowing over the lake  the prince who was in the boat with the youngest princess and the soldier said  "I do not know why it is  but though I am rowing with all my might we do not get on so fast as usual  and I am quite tired: the boat seems very heavy today " "It is only the heat of the weather " said the princess  "I am very warm  too " On the other side of the lake stood a fine  illuminated17 castle from which came the merry music of horns and trumpets18  There they all landed  and went into the castle  and each prince danced with his princess; and the soldier  who was still invisible  danced with them too  When any of the princesses had a cup of wine set by her  he drank it all up  so that when she put the cup to her mouth it was empty  At this  too  the youngest sister was terribly frightened  but the eldest always silenced her  They danced on till three o'clock in the morning  and then all their shoes were worn out  so that they were obliged to leave  The princes rowed them back again over the lake (but this time the soldier placed himself in the boat with the eldest princess); and on the opposite shore they took leave of each other  the princesses promising19 to come again the next night  When they came to the stairs  the soldier ran on before the princesses  and laid himself down  And as the twelve  tired sisters slowly came up  they heard him snoring in his bed and they said  "Now all is quite safe"  Then they undressed themselves  put away their fine clothes  pulled off their shoes  and went to bed  In the morning the soldier said nothing about what had happened  but determined to see more of this strange adventure  and went again on the second and third nights  Everything happened just as before: the princesses danced till their shoes were worn to pieces  and then returned home  On the third night the soldier carried away one of the golden cups as a token of where he had been  As soon as the time came when he was to declare the secret  he was taken before the king with the three branches and the golden cup; and the twelve princesses stood listening behind the door to hear what he would say  The king asked him  "Where do my twelve daughters dance at night " The soldier answered  "With twelve princes in a castle underground " And then he told the king all that had happened  and showed him the three branches and the golden cup which he had brought with him  The king called for the princesses  and asked them whether what the soldier said was true and when they saw that they were discovered  and that it was of no use to deny what had happened  they confessed it all  So the king asked the soldier which of the princesses he would choose for his wife; and he answered  "I am not very young  so I will have the eldest " -- and they were married that very day  and the soldier was chosen to be the king's heir1
