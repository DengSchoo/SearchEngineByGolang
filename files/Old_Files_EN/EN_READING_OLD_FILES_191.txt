One windy spring day I observed young people having fun using the wind to fly their kites Multicolored creations of varying shapes and sizes filled the skies like beautiful birds darting1 and dancing As the strong winds gusted2 against the kites a string kept them in check Instead of blowing away with the wind they arose against it to achieve great heights They shook and pulled but the restraining string and the cumbersome3 tail kept them in tow facing upward and against the wind As the kites struggled and kept them in tow facing upward and against the wind As the kites struggled and trembled against the string they seemed to say Let me go Let me go I want to be free they soared beautifully even as they fought the restriction4 of the string Finally one of the kites succeeded in breaking loose Free at last it seemed to say Free to fly with the wind Yet freedom from restraint simply put it at the mercy of an unsympathetic breeze It fluttered ungracefully to the ground and landed in a tangled5 mass of weeds and string against a dead bush Free at last free to lie powerless in the dirt to be blown helplessly along the ground and to lodge6 lifeless against the first obstruction7 How much like kites we sometimes are The heaven gives us adversity and restrictions8 rules to follow from which we can grow and gain strength Restraint is a necessary counterpart to the winds of opposition9 Some of us tug10 at the rules so hard that we never soar to reach the heights we might have obtained We keep part of the commandment and never rise high enough to get our tails off the ground Let us each rise to the great heights recognizing that some of the restraints that we may chafe11 under are actually the steadying force that helps us ascend12 and achieve lps us ascend12 and achieve  trolley with heavy items first - tins bottles and potatoes - intensifies6 the workout  	 	Calories burned per hour: Up to 200 with a heavy shop 	 	Equivalent exercise: 40 minutes of badminton 	 	A LONG HOT BATH 	 	Sinking gently into a hot bath is all about relaxing and singing along to Radio 2 not dieting surely  	 	Not so: a Loughborough University study revealed that a steamy bath of 40c can melt away 140 calories (that's a significant 7 percent of a daily allowance of 2 000) and that sitting in one for an hour causes an 80 percent increase in energy expenditure7 lowering blood glucose8 levels as a result  	 	Calories burned per hour: Up to 140 	 	Equivalent exercise: 15 minutes' vigorous swimming 	 	HAVING A GOOD LAUGH 	 	It's hard to believe that sitting in the cinema watching the Ab Fab movie could do you as much good as a post-work circuit of the gym but laughter is a full-body experience that can leave you as exhausted9 as a treadmill10 session  	 	Research from Vanderbilt University Nashville published in the International Journal of Obesity11 found that just 15 minutes of good hard laughing a day will burn up to 40 calories - enough to drop 4 lb of excess weight a year 	 	Try laughing little and often whether it's during a phone call with your best friend or watching a DVD of your favourite comedian12  	 	Calories burned per hour: Up to 160 	 	Equivalent exercise: Half an hour of physically demanding gardeningout my problems and felt strong and secure 
	 
	As I see it  horses are silent too  but they are fast  powerful and free at the same time  Horses give me the strength I lack  They give me a reason to push myself  when I can find no other  Horses have been part of my life for well over twenty years now  all the while helping9 me deal with an isolating10  frightening disorder  When things get difficult  as they still sometimes do  I go to my horses  With them  I can be silent  but I can hold my head up and have dignity and freedom  By connecting with them  I have learned to embrace what I was once shunned11 for and I found my voice 
	 
	I am a fully4 participating member of society these days  My horses and I made it through a master's degree and then law school  I am a practicing attorney  I even make court appearances  I may have made it otherwise  but I'm not sure  I feel I owe my life to the horse and I try to give it back to them every day  I am fortunate that I can look out my back door and see my beautiful horses looking back at me  I am so grateful that I get to watch them run in their mountain pasture every day  I hope I never stop learning from them  They have given me the best gift I could ever imagine  my life own how much she and her husband needed it  With the baby due next month  it was going to be hard  She knew how worried her husband was  and as he lay sleeping next to her  she gave him a soft kiss and whispered soft and low  "Everything's gonna be all right; I love you  Bryan "
