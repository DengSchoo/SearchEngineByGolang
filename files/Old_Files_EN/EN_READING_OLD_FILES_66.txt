I cant imagine being attracted to someone who isnt intelligent My wife is one of the smartest people Ive ever met and its a major part of the pleasure of being with her Ninetyeight percent of a relationship consists of talking to the other person; why would I want to spend that time talking to someone who says dumb1 things Oh yes definitely2 I swear to God after meeting a lot of women I had come to a conclusion that intelligent women are like aliens3 You never get to meet them and you hear rumors4 about them that they exist I personally love talking to intelligent women They are sexier than the sexy ones Nothing is so necessary for a young man as the company of intelligent women Leo TolstoyIntelligent men do Tolstoy	 	Intelligent men do f the dining experience 	 	You are telling yourself a story as to why the person is eating alone You are mind reading or attempting to guess the situation of a person you know nothing about 	 	That person might just want to have a bit of peace and quiet while eating They need not be the social outcasts that you think they are 	 	Or perhaps it is you who have the problem Maybe you are afraid to be alone Maybe you grew up with a lot of siblings6 and have been surrounded with family members and were taught that you have to have people around you all of the time Maybe you are afraid of what you will hear in your mind when the sounds of the world shut off and you are left with only yourself for company ious depression caused by other factors Writing for the BBC author and presenter7 Claudia Hammond argues that this low feeling might be a myth She says: "There is a strong cultural idea that we don't like Mondays " She mentions an Australian study in 2008 about how people reflected on their mood and found the day that scored the lowest was in fact Wednesdays So when Monday comes maybe we should give it a second chance tweigh9 the cons is something everyone must decide for themselves  Some people prefer their own space  while others thrive in a social environment  Regardless  for many who lack the means to buy their own property  a flatshare is  and will continue to be  a necessity what you want to do 	 	You know what happens when you start over analyzing something  You stress yourself out  You wear yourself out  you worry  you over think  you make stuff up in your head  and you over exaggerate  What an imagination our brains have  But seriously speaking  there's only so much analyzing you can do  At some point you're going to have to kick your ass5 into gear  At some point you'll have to put the key in the ignition  start the engine  and push the pedal  You can't do that with your mind 	 	4 Procrastinating6 won't get you anywhere 	 	Getting started is easy  simple  and doable  Yet procrastinating is also easy to do  Ironic7 isn't it  But the truth is  delaying what you've been dying to do isn't going to benefit you  At best  it'll hinder you in more ways than one  Remember what I said earlier about what we do everyday is a habit  Well If you procrastinate8 enough  that habit will creep into other parts of your life as well  If you procrastinate with simple things  you'll procrastinate with harder things  One leads to another  Start small If you must  but at the least you need to get started 	 	3 The last thing you want to do is regret not starting 	 	Regretting what you've done is one thing  but regretting what you've never done is another  Lets be honest  regretting what you haven't done is so much worse  Especially when it's something you're adamant9 to do  You don't want to be that person who regrets it 30 years from now  do you 	 	2 You can adjust your actions along the way 	 	Ready  aim  fire  You've heard of the saying  right  Well what happens if you spend all your time aiming  and not firing  You'll never hit anything  That's basically what you're doing by thinking too much and not getting started  Ready  fire  aim should be your approach  You might not get it right on the first shot  but you can adjust your aim as you go along 	 	It's better to make a mistake than do nothing at all 	 	This ties in with the last point I just made  I don't like to make mistakes  you don't like to mistakes  nobody likes to make mistakes  But nobody's perfect so it's impossible not to make a mistake  As great as computers and smartphones are  even they can make mistakes  You can't get away from it  And that's OK  Just be sure to get started on whatever you've been delaying for so long  And when you do make a mistake  learn from it and get it right the next time  Then you'll be way ahead  I can guarantee you that
