Manage your emotionsEmotions can ruin your day and subsequently1 any healthy progress youve made Teeter warns One bad day at work can lead to binge eating and drinking in front of the TV instead of preparing a nourishing2 meal and hitting the gym When youre feeling bad Teeter recommends paying attention to why you feel that way so you can comfort yourself in a more productive3 way instead of stuffing yourself full of food until you cant move Focus on feeling better rather than what you see in the mirrorSometimes looking good in a bathing suit isnt a big enough goal at least not if you want to keep the weight off for longer than the warm summer months Its important to establish the reason why you want to get healthy Maybe its for your kids or grandkids Byers suggests Maybe you want to get healthy so you can have a family No matter where you are in your journey I encourage you to think about your personal why and post it on a vision board where you can see it every day Track your progress with picturesWhile its important to focus on how you feel over how you look Byers also suggests taking pictures every week so you can visually track your progress On a daytoday basis you might not notice the changes that a photo will capture The scale can be misleading it doesnt know if youre replacing fat with muscle notes Byers The more muscle you have the more toned4 you look as long as your nutrition is on point Dont eat or drink anything handed to you through a windowYes even coffee Get up and go inside to get your coffee if you want it that bad Marie suggests Better yet go someplace where you can control how much sugar and cream goes into it Step outside your comfort zoneEmbrace uncertainty5 especially if you consider yourself a perfectionist Things will not always go your way no matter how prepared you think you are Teeter says Many folks throw in the towel after just one setback6 But if you condition yourself to expect and embrace [setbacks youll be far happier with yourself and the progress youre making even during the difficult times Eat a lean protein and complex carb during each mealFor Byers that meant lots of grilled7 chicken with sweet potatoes grilled zucchini with asparagus and mealreplacement shakes One of my favorite meals is scrambled8 egg whites with hash browns and green salsa mixed together she says Another favorite is extralean turkey tacos on corn tortillas and avocado slices plus salsa Start todayThe sooner you start the sooner youll see results: There will always be reasons to start tomorrow or wait until your busy season is over Lehman adds Fight through your excuses and do something right now wait until your busy season is over " Lehman adds "Fight through your excuses and do something right now "wo losses At graduation the coach named Daniel the team's most valuable player 	 	His finest hour though came at a school science fair He entered an exhibit showing how the circulatory system works It was primitive10 and crude especially compared to the fancy computerized blinking-light models entered by other students My wife Sara felt embarrassed for him 	 	It turned out that the other kids had not done their own work-their parents had made their exhibits As the judges went on their rounds they found that these other kids couldn't answer their questions Daniel answered every one When the judges awarded the Albert Einstein Plaque11 for the best exhibit they gave it to him 	 	By the time Daniel left for college he stood six feet tall and weighed 170 pounds He was muscular and in superb condition but he never pitched another inning having given up baseball for English literature I was sorry that he would not develop his athletic12 talent but proud that he had made such a mature decision 	 	One day I told Daniel that the great failing in my life had been that I didn't take a year or two off to travel when I finished college This is the best way to my way of thinking to broaden oneself and develop a larger perspective on life Once I had married and begun working I found that the dream of living in another culture had vanished 	 	Daniel thought about this His friends said that he would be insane to put his career on hold But he decided13 it wasn't so crazy After graduation he worked as a waiter at college a bike messenger and a house painter With the money he earned he had enough to go to Paris 	 	The night before he was to leave I tossed in bed I was trying to figure out something to say Nothing came to mind Maybe I thought it wasn't necessary to say anything #p##e#	 	What does it matter in the course of a life-time if a father never tells a son what he really thinks of him But as I stood before Daniel I knew that it does matter My father and I loved each other Yet I always regretted never hearing him put his feelings into words and never having the memory of that moment Now I could feel my palms sweat and my throat tighten14 Why is it so hard to tell a son something from the heart My mouth turned dry and I knew I would be able to get out only a few words clearly 	 	"Daniel " I said "if I could have picked I would have picked you "	 	That's all I could say I wasn't sure he understood what I meant Then he came toward me and threw his arms around me For a moment the world and all its people vanished and there was just Daniel and me in our home by the sea 	 	He was saying something but my eyes misted over and I couldn't understand what he was saying All I was aware of was the stubble on his chin as his face pressed against mine And then the moment ended I went to work and Daniel left a few hours later with his girlfriend 	 	That was seven weeks ago and I think about him when I walk along the beach on weekends Thousands of miles away somewhere out past the ocean waves breaking on the deserted15 shore he might be scurrying16 across Boulevard Saint Germain strolling through a musty hallway of the Louvre bending an elbow in a Left Bank café 	 	What I had said to Daniel was clumsy and trite17 It was nothing And yet it was everything
