Theres no place like home Its the place where were surrounded by our possessions and creature comforts We purchase things to give our homes a personal touch and create a certain ambience And one thing were buying more of is houseplants But are these living additions to our homes good for us and the environment Houseplants also known as pot plants have Instagramfriendly appeal; add a natural touch and they have the ability to brighten up a room on a budget The Royal Horticultural Society found that nearly 72 of adults in the UK had a houseplant in their home with this figure rising to 80 of 1624 year olds A fifth of owners also said they use plants in the home to boost their health and wellbeing1 And average sales last year were up on the previous year It seems millennials are driving the growth in the sales of houseplants According to research by The Economist3 more young people are living in flats without a garden 24 yearold Daisy Hale told the BBC being able to care for something but not having too much commitment I guess thats a classic millennial2 line is ideal for my lifestyle From hanging baskets to cacti4 and succulent ferns the choice of vegetation is endless They are easy to care for and there have been unproven claims that they improve the air quality in our home But whatever their benefits there are now concerns that they might not be so good for the environment Some are bought online and shipped from overseas Fay Kenworthy cofounder of PlantSwap a community initiative that encourages people to trade plants locally told the BBC this could rack up plant miles But botanist5 and BBC presenter6 James Wong argues that home delivery has less of an environmental impact than multiple trips to the garden centre in a car Although hes not too concerned about the environmental impact others are worried about the plastic pots they are in and the type of peat that some of them are grown in However a sustainable approach to buying them may be the best way forward if we want to introduce some natural greenery into our homes  introduce some natural greenery into our homes ght and reflection twilight10 and deep water You need me for balance and contrast for prayer and inner peace "	 	And so the colors went on boasting each convinced of his or her own superiority Their quarreling became louder and louder 	 	Suddenly there was a startling flash of bright lightening thunder rolled and boomed Rain started to pour down relentlessly11 The colors crouched12 down in fear drawing close to one another for comfort 	 	In the midst of the clamor rain began to speak:" You foolish colors fighting amongst yourselves each trying to dominate the rest Don't you know that you were each made for a special purpose unique and different Join hands with one another and come to me "	 	Doing as they were told the colors united and joined hands 	 	The rain continued:" From now on when it rains each of you will stretch across the sky in a great bow of color as a reminder13 that you can all live in peace The Rainbow is a sign of hope for tomorrow " And so whenever a good rain washes the world and a Rainbow appears in the sky let us remember to appreciate one another  a few chapters  Or even when I’m cooking  I can throw on an audiobook 
	 
	Each of us have a lot more time in the day than we realize  but that time can often get frittered away if used without intention  Audiobooks are a means of using time more intentionally11 and in a manner conducive12 to a reading goal  They fill in the downtime with books and reading 
	 
	Most audiobooks are between 6 and 10 hours long  some of them push upwards of 12 to 15  But even for longer books  the total time is negligible when spread across weeks or months 
	 
	Consider the math once again: If you have a thirty-minute commute13 to work each way  that is potentially an hour per day to listen to a book  Or  if you only want to listen in the morning  for example  thirty minutes of extra reading per day remains14 excellent – you could get through nearly two  8-hour audiobooks per month at thirty minutes a day  I would be remiss15 to ignore the small faction16 of readers who do not count audiobooks as “reading ” So here is me addressing them  Personally  I do count audiobooks as reading – a book read aloud is still a book 
	 
	By implementing a regular time block for reading each day  reading turns into a habit and becomes automated17  Thinking about when you can “fit in” time to read no longer applies once it becomes a routine part of your day  Soon enough  it becomes an integral piece of your identity as well – you see yourself as a “reader” and so do others  which further motivates and compounds the habit of reading  Next  try out an audiobook  Give yourself a month to listen to one book  you’ll realize that you fly through the book much quicker than this  It’s a fun and leisurely18 way of reading more books  And who doesn’t like being read to by someone else 
	 
	With these two ideas  you and me and everyone else can actually read more books
