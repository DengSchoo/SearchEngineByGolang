There is a story many years ago of an elementary teacher Her name was Mrs Thompson And as she stood in front of her 5th grade class on the very first day of school she told the children a lie Like most teachers she looked at her students and said that she loved them all the same But that was impossible because there in the front row slumped1 in his seat was a little boy named Teddy  Mrs Thompson had watched Teddy the year before and noticed that he didn't play well with the other children that his clothes were messy and that he constantly needed a bath And Teddy could be unpleasant  At the school where Mrs Thompson taught she was required to review each child's past records and she put Teddy's off until last However when she reviewed his file she was in for a surprise  Teddy's first grade teacher wrote "Teddy is a bright child with a ready laugh He does his work neatly2 and has good manners he is a joy to be around " His second grade teacher wrote "Teddy is an excellent student well-liked by his classmates but he is troubled because his mother has a terminal illness and life at home must be a struggle " His third grade teacher wrote "His mother's death has been hard on him He tries to do his best but his father doesn't show much interest and his home life will soon affect him if some steps aren't taken " Teddy's fourth grade teacher wrote "Teddy is withdrawn3 and doesn't show much interest in school He doesn't have many friends and sometimes sleeps in class " By now Mrs Thompson realized the problem and she was ashamed of herself She felt even worse when her students brought her Christmas presents wrapped in beautiful ribbons and bright paper except for Teddy's His present was clumsily wrapped in the heavy brown paper that he got from a grocery bag Mrs Thompson took pains to open it in the middle of the other presents Some of the children started to laugh when she found a rhinestone4 bracelet5 with some of the stones missing and a bottle that was one quarter full of perfume She stifled6 the children's laughter when she exclaimed how pretty the bracelet was putting it on and dabbing7 some of the perfume on her wrist  Teddy stayed after school that day just long enough to say "Mrs Thompson today you smelled just like my Mom used to " After the children left she cried for at least an hour  On that very day she quit teaching reading and writing and arithmetic Instead she began to teach children  Mrs Thompson paid particular attention to Teddy As she worked with him his mind seemed to come alive The more she encouraged him the faster he responded By the end of the year Teddy had become one of the smartest children in the class and despite her lie that she would love all the children same Teddy became one of her "teacher's pets " A year later she found a note under her door from Teddy telling her that she was still the best teacher he ever had in his whole life  Six years went by before she got another note from Teddy He then wrote that he had finished high school second in his class and she was still the best teacher he ever had in his whole life  Four years after that she got another letter saying that while things had been tough at times he'd stayed in school had stuck with it and would soon graduate from college with the highest of honors He assured Mrs Thompson that she was still the best and favorite teacher he ever had in his whole life  Then four more years passed and yet another letter came This time he explained that after he got his bachelor's degree he decided8 to go a little further The letter explained that she was still the best and favorite teacher he ever had But now his name was a little longer The letter was signed Theodore F Stoller M D  The story doesn't end there You see there was yet another letter that spring Teddy said he'd met this girl and was going to be married He explained that his father had died a couple of years ago and he was wondering if Mrs Thompson might agree to sit in the place at the wedding that was usually reserved for the mother of the groom9  Of course Mrs Thompson did And guess what She wore that bracelet the one with several rhinestones10 missing And she made sure she was wearing the perfume that Teddy remembered his mother wearing on their last Christmas together  They hugged each other and Teddy whispered in Mrs Thompson's ear "Thank you Mrs Thompson for believing in me Thank you so much for making me feel important and showing me that I could make a difference " Mrs Thompson with tears in her eyes whispered back She said "Teddy you have it all wrong You were the one who taught me that I could make a difference I didn't know how to teach until I met you "" " I thought  "at least I'll all my problems will go away when I die " Now the tsunami was only a kilometre away  and was coming closer with each passing second  "Good-bye world  good-bye life  good-bye Steve " I said as the tsunami was only a few seconds from tearing me apart #p#    #e# "Good-bye life  Try good-bye tsunami " shouted a voice from above  I looked up  There  in midair  was a chopper to rescue me  "Grab on " shouted the voice as he threw down a rope ladder  I quickly grabbed hold of it and just barely missed the tsunami  I looked down as I was being pulled up  Boom  The tsunami crashed in the spot where I was before  awaiting my death  But I realized that life was too good to give up  so I cheated death  by a hair  "where am I  And who are you " I asked in a weary voice  "You're home  and my name's Steve " said the voice  "What " That was I could say before I slumped20 into a deep sleep     "Joey  Joey " said a mysterious voice  I opened my eyes  "Joey  Joey " repeated the voice  I looked at my surroundings  and found out that I was in a hospital bed  and that I was not alone  I looked at my visitor  He had blue eyes  brown hair  a gaunt face  all of the features that Steve had  I gasped21  "Steve " I asked  "Yes " he replied  "But  you're- " "No  I didn't die " he replied  "But  how " "It doesn't matter now  but I'll tell you someday  The main priority for you is to get better " he said  "Don't worry  your parents will be here soon " I smiled and thought in my head  "So many good things happened in my life  and so many of them lost  But this adventure  I shall never forget " I took one last look around me  and then I closed my eyes
