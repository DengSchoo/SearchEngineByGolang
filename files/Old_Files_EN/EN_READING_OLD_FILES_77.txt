Finding a new job isnt always easy You search for a suitable vacancy1 send in an application form and if that goes well you might be invited for an interview For some this is when the panic sets in youre going to be faced by a panel of strangers wholl fire difficult questions at you and youll have to actually prove yourself But how would you feel if instead of being asked why you want the job youre asked to stand up and dance From the perspective of a company it wants to hire the right person because they can make a big difference to the success of the organisation2 It therefore needs to test a candidate in the most appropriate way to discover how suitable he or she may be A good interview process should involve rigorous screening of job applicants4 and effective questions that every applicant3 gets asked But thats not always the case Alison Green is an author and creator of the workplace advice column Ask a Manager She told the BBC that some companies give their interviewers little or no training and often leave them completely on their own when it comes to figuring out what to ask job candidates She mentions that some interviewers are too casual and some focus on building a good rapport5 and end up hiring the candidate they just clicked with regardless of their skills and abilities An inexperienced interviewer may think its clever to ask if you were an animal what kind would you be That has been asked Alison Green says but in reality this has no connection with the job And there have been inappropriate requests such as one job seeker being asked to show the interviewer the inside of her handbag to demonstrate how organised she was Talking of inappropriate the BBC heard from a number of people who were surprised by the questions they were asked in an interview Mature student Kevin Helton said that the interviewer asked you used to be in the Army how many people have you killed But as Alison Green points out while a candidate might feel at the mercy of an interviewer they are able to question why theyre being asked something and while the interviewer might be making judgements the candidate can also make their own judgement and decide if this is really the career move they want to make ally the career move they want to make  tiny and soft underfoot 	 		After a street cleaner has done the sweeping24 under the shade of the trees you will discover countless25 lines left by his broom in the dust which look so fine and quiet that somehow a feeling of forlornness will begin to creep up on you The same depth of implication is found in the ancient saying that a single fallen leaf from the wutong tree is more than enough to inform the world of autumn's presence 	 		The sporadic26 feeble chirping of cicadas is especially characteristic of autumn in the North Due to the abundance of trees and the low altitude of dwellings27 in Peiping cicadas are audible in every nook and cranny of the city In the South however one cannot hear them unless in suburbs or hills Because of their ubiquitous shrill28 noise these insects in Peiping seem to be living off every household like crickets or mice 	 		As for autumn rains in the North they also seem to differ from those in the South being more appealing more temperate29 	 		A sudden gust30 of cool wind under the slaty31 sky and raindrops will start pitter-pattering Soon when the rain is over the clouds begin gradually to roll towards the west and the sun comes out in the blue sky Some idle townsfolk wearing lined or unlined clothing made of thick cloth will come out pipe in mouth and loitering under a tree by the end of a bridge exchange leisurely conversation with acquaintances with a slight touch of regret at the passing of time:	 		"Oh real nice and cool"	"Sure Getting cooler with each autumn shower "	 	golden days	Fruit trees in the North also make a wonderful sight in autumn Take jujube tree for example They grow everywherearound the corner of a house at the foot of a wall by the side of a latrine or outside a kitchen door It is at the height of autumn that jujubes shaped like dates or pigeon eggs make their appearance in a light yellowish-green amongst tiny elliptic leaves By the time when they have turned ruddy and the leaves fallen the north-westerly wind will begin to reign32 supreme33 and make a dusty world of the North Only at the turn of July and August when jujubes persimmons grapes are 80-90 percent ripe will the North have the best of autumnthe golden days in a year 	 	anthology 	Some literary critics say that Chinese literati especially poets are mostly disposed to be decadent34 which accounts for predominance of Chinese works singing the praises of autumn Well the same is true of foreign poets isn't it I haven't read much of foreign poetry and prose nor do I want to enumerate35 autumn-related poems and essays in foreign literature But if you browse36 through collected works of English German French or Italian poets or various countries' anthologies of poetry or prose you can always comes across a great many literary pieces eulogizing or lamenting37 autumn Long pastoral poems or songs about the four seasons by renowned38 poets are mostly distinguished39 by beautiful moving lines on autumn All that goes to show that all live creatures and sensitive humans alike are prone40 to the feeling of depth remoteness severity and bleakness41 	 		Not only poets even convicts in prison I suppose have deep sentiments in autumn in spite of themselves Autumn treats all humans alike regardless of nationality race or class However judging from Chinese idiom qiushi (autumn scholar meaning and aged42 scholar grieving over frustrations43 in his life) and frequent selection in textbooks of Ouyang Xiu's On the Autumn Sough and Su Dongpo's On the Red Cliff Chinese men of letters seem to be particularly autumn-minded But to know the real flavour of autumn especially China's autumn one has to visit the North 	 		Autumn in the South also has its unique features such as the moonlit Ershisi Bridge in Yangzhou the flowing sea tide at the Qiantangjiang River the mist-shrouded Putuo Mountain and lotuses at the Lizhiwan Bay But they all lack strong colour and lingering flavour Southern autumn is to Northern autumn what yellow rice wine is to kaoliang wine congee44 to steamed buns perches45 to crabs46 yellow dogs to camels 	 		Autumn I mean Northern autumn if only it could be made to last forever I would be more than willing to keep but one-third of my life-span and have two-thirds of it bartered47 for the prolonged stay of the season
