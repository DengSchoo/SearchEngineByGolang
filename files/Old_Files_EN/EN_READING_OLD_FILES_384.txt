Your beliefs are very powerful and have the power to create or to destroy your life  In most cases whatever you believe is what you will become  If you believe that you are loser that you never get a break in life that you can't accomplish anything these things will be your reality  Believe that you are unlimited1 that you can do anything you commit to doing and when you do your accomplishments2 will know no bounds  You control your beliefs and that is how you ultimately control of your life  This is a very important point  So how do you develop beliefs that will empower you  Many of our beliefs come from our environment the world we live in on a daily basis  If your environment is limiting your beliefs then work very hard on changing it  If you are constantly around people who are negative and limiting find other people to hang out with  Get around positive successful people  Beliefs also come from past experiences  That is why it is so important to experience success on a regular basis  Set small achievable goals and then try your best to reach them  "I will finish this project by early afternoon " "I will make six calls on the phone in the next hour " "I will exercise for 20 minutes tonight " When you start to experience success then you start to believe in success and that leads to more and bigger successes  Beliefs come from knowledge  The more you learn the more things you will know to be possible  Always take advantage of opportunities to learn something new It will bring new possibilities into your beliefs and your life  Most importantly you can develop new beliefs by setting and visualizing3 goals for your life  Define your goals clearly and with precision  Then in your mind see yourself achieving them in all of their sensory4 details  Mentally live the experience see the sights hear the sounds smell the aroma5 feel the feelings Your nurtured6 beliefs will lead you to their reality  a rhinestone4 bracelet5 with some of the stones missing and a bottle that was one quarter full of perfume  She stifled6 the children's laughter when she exclaimed how pretty the bracelet was  putting it on  and dabbing7 some of the perfume on her wrist  Teddy stayed after school that day just long enough to say  "Mrs  Thompson  today you smelled just like my Mom used to " After the children left she cried for at least an hour  On that very day  she quit teaching reading  and writing  and arithmetic  Instead  she began to teach children  Mrs  Thompson paid particular attention to Teddy  As she worked with him  his mind seemed to come alive  The more she encouraged him  the faster he responded  By the end of the year  Teddy had become one of the smartest children in the class and  despite her lie that she would love all the children same  Teddy became one of her "teacher's pets " A year later  she found a note under her door  from Teddy  telling her that she was still the best teacher he ever had in his whole life  Six years went by before she got another note from Teddy  He then wrote that he had finished high school  second in his class  and she was still the best teacher he ever had in his whole life  Four years after that  she got another letter  saying that while things had been tough at times  he'd stayed in school  had stuck with it  and would soon graduate from college with the highest of honors  He assured Mrs  Thompson that she was still the best and favorite teacher he ever had in his whole life  Then four more years passed and yet another letter came  This time he explained that after he got his bachelor's degree  he decided8 to go a little further  The letter explained that she was still the best and favorite teacher he ever had  But now his name was a little longer  The letter was signed  Theodore F  Stoller  M D  The story doesn't end there  You see  there was yet another letter that spring  Teddy said he'd met this girl and was going to be married  He explained that his father had died a couple of years ago and he was wondering if Mrs  Thompson might agree to sit in the place at the wedding that was usually reserved for the mother of the groom9  Of course  Mrs  Thompson  did  And guess what  She wore that bracelet  the one with several rhinestones10 missing  And she made sure she was wearing the perfume that Teddy remembered his mother wearing on their last Christmas together  They hugged each other  and Teddy whispered in Mrs  Thompson's ear  "Thank you  Mrs  Thompson  for believing in me  Thank you so much for making me feel important and showing me that I could make a difference " Mrs  Thompson  with tears in her eyes  whispered back  She said  "Teddy  you have it all wrong  You were the one who taught me that I could make a difference  I didn't know how to teach until I met you "
