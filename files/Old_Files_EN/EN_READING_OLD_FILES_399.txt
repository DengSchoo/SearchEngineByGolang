Love is a lamp while friendship is the shadow When the lamp is off you will find the shadow everywhere Friend is who can give you strength at last  I love you not for who you are but for who I am before you  Love makes man grow up or sink down  Happiness is not about being immortal1 nor having food or rights in one's hand It's about having each tiny wish come true or having something to eat when you are hungry or having someone's love when you need love  One is always on a strange road watching strange scenery2 and listening to strange music Then one day you will find that the things you try hard to forget are already gone  If you can hold something up and put it down it is called weight-lifting; if you can hold something up but can never put it down it's called burden-bearing3 Pitifully most of people are bearing heavy burdens4 when they are in love ars  a human life would take about ten seconds  But look at time the other way  Each day is a minor6 eternity7 of over 86000 seconds  During each second  the number of distinct molecular8 functions going on with the human body is comparable to the mumber of seconds in the estimated age of the cosmos  A few seconds are long enough for a revolutionary idea  a startling communication  a baby's conception  a wounding insult  a sudden death  Depending on how we think of them  our lives can be infinitely9 long or infinitely short tion  experience and　conscientions effort to the best possible solution for a given problem  When deadlines have to be met at the earliest a person's competence is the only handy tool that will see him through that deadline   A competent person has no ifs and buts in his vocabulary  He won't fix a blame for failure on something or someone  but will modulate12 himself to rectify13 the situation  Commitment: A proper canalization of one's energy   enthusiasm  talent and thoughts into completing a given project or thoughts is commitment  Commitment calls in for a firm mental resolve to fulfill14 the job at hand and see it through  A committed person won't rest on his laurels15 till he has completed his duty   No one is born perfect  But one can hone one's skills by being true to oneself  Early realization16 of the important change in your life can take you places  So be far sighted and yes do let me know the results
