Charlie Plumb1 was a US Navy jet pilot in Vietnam  He flew 74 consecutive2 successful combat missions  However on his 75th mission  his F4Phantom fighter was destroyed by a surface-to-air missile and he was forced to eject  The only thing between him and imminent3 death was his parachute that he prayed would open  The parachute did open and Charlie made it down to the ground alive  but he was captured and spent 6 years as a prisoner of war in a Vietnamese prison camp  One day  many years after returning to his homeland  Charlie and his wife were sitting in a little restaurant in Kansas City when he noticed two tables over was this guy who kept looking at him  Charlie looked back but didn't recognize him  but he kept catching4 this guy staring at him  Finally the guy stood up and walked over to Charlie's table and said  "You're Captain Plumb "Charlie looked up at him and said  "Yes  I am Captain Plumb  "The guy said " You're that guy  You flew jet fighters in Vietnam  You're a fighter pilot  part of that 'Top Gun' outfit5  You launched from the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk6  you parachuted into enemy territory and you spent six years as a prisoner of war " Somewhat dumbfounded  Charlie looked up at the guy and asked  "How in the world did you know all that " The man chuckled7 and said  "Because I packed your parachute " Charlie was speechless  The man grabbed Charlie's hand and pumped his arm and said  "I guess it worked " and walked off  Charlie laid awake that night  thinking about all the times he had walked through the long narrow room  below sea level on the aircraft carrier  with the tables where the men packed the parachutes  He wondered how many times he must have walked past this man without even saying "hi " "good morning" or "good job" or "I appreciate what you do "   "How many times did I pass the man whose job would eventually save my life   because I was a jet jockey  a top gun racing8 around the sky at twice the speed of sound  because I was a fighter pilot and he was just a sailor " he asked himself  Think about this for yourself  How many times in life do you pass the people who help you out the most  The people who come out of the far corners of your life just when you need them the most and pack your parachutes for you  The people who go the extra mile  the people who don't look for the kudos9 or the accolades10 or the achievement medal or even the bonus check -- the folks who are just out there packing parachutes tions  10  A good conversation in their eyes doesn't revolve4 around how much money you make or how successful you are  They're more interested in hearing what makes you tick  what inspires you  what gets your blood flowing  and what you're passionate about  11  They know that sometimes they have a hard time opening up in the beginning  They're used to being in control  so when they're not  it's a little disorienting  But they enjoy the challenge of trying to get better  so it's something they're always keen to work on  12  They won't ask you to choose between them and your other priorities  because they're too busy having priorities of their own  13  Ambitious girls are attracted to people who have goals and aspirations5 - people who want more than an average existence  They don't need you to be the CEO of a Fortune 500 or an insanely successful entrepreneur  They just want to know you care about something that matters and are willing to work for it  14  They're not going to wait forever  They'll let you know  one way or another  that they like you  They're never in a rush to jump into a relationship  but they're also practical about where they are in their lives and when it's time to move on  If you like them  do something about it  15  They're less worried about a fairytale romance and more concerned with finding someone who will simply make them happy  They're not preoccupied6 with a huge diamond ring  an over-the-top wedding  and a ridiculous love story they can tell their friends  They just want to be with someone who will love them for who they are  and never ask them to stop following their dreams
