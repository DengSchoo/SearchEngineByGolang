I was sitting on the beach the other day watching a kite (In the shape of a two winged aircraft) flying high in the sky It made wonderful acrobatic maneuvers1 as if piloted by a person with a lifetimes experience of flying However we all know a kite cannot fly without the power of the wind So how real was the performance I was watching  Firstly it took a person with great imagination to design a kite shaped like a tiger moth2 aircraft that can encompass3 the aerodynamics to be powered by the wind That accomplishment4 in itself takes great skill and awareness5 of the forces of nature  Secondly6 the person who purchased the kite needs to read the instructions and learn how to apply the winds forces to achieve a great display The mind and hand coordination7 requires a mastery to attain8 the required skills  Thirdly without the power of the wind the kite would just be a charming colorful textured9 replica10 of a Tiger Moth aircraft We cannot see the wind but we know it must exist for we can feel it and see the consequences of its power  So we have a relationship between the designer and manufacturer which ultimately will connect to the user It then needs a power of nature that cannot be seen in order to allow the kite to operate The display I was observing had a lot of behind the scenes work that needed to be performed before the show could go on  y adjusting itself to changing conditions without the concentration camp or the quicklime in the ditch The world order which we seek is the cooperation of free countries working together in a friendly civilized6 society  This nation has placed its destiny in the hands heads and hearts of its millions of free men and women and its faith in freedom under the guidance of God Freedom means the supremacy7 of human rights everywhere Our support goes to those who struggle to gain those rights and keep them Our strength is our unity8 of purpose  To that high concept there can be no end save victory
