The first time I saw Kai she was sitting in my front yard hugging my dog Harley HarleyShe and her husband Sean had just moved into a tiny home down the hill from us SeanI think she was drawn1 to Harleys friendly personality just as he was drawn to hers HarleyFrom the second I talked to her I knew Kai would be a cherished friend Her smile and good cheer made me feel better just being around her Her high voice was always full of happiness Before I knew it she was inviting2 me and my children into her house for homemade cake It didnt take long before Kai was beloved by everyone in our neighborhood Children and adults alike visited her home often Although she already had four cats she adopted a stray beagle that had been hurt by a bear and nursed it back to health When we visited her she would kindly3 listen to all of our troublesand then say something so wise and upliftingthat we would leave her home with our mouths smiling and our hearts singing Sometimes I would read her my storieswhile one of her cats would nap on my lapand she would always encourage me to keep writing and sharing with the world Kai wasnt Hawaiian but loved the Hawaiian culture and spirit of family it cherished She was even a hula dancer in her younger days hulaShe gave me a Hawaiian shirt that I loved so muchthat soon I bought several others to go with itand today they are the only kind of shirt I wear Each time I see them hanging in my closet I think of her Kai was a true giver She didnt have much to share materiallybut what she gave to others spiritually was truly priceless She gave everything she could to everyone she could every chance she could She had lived a life of such unconditional4 love All of this time though Kai was slowly dying from a terrible combination of Cancer and C O P D She had told me the first time we talked that she was terminal Yet she lived each day with such vitality5 that I often forgot just how ill she was In time her health did wane6 and she spent more and more time resting and sleeping I still visited her but only on her few good days She died on a cold Winters day with heavy snow falling down like teardrops from sky In spite of the short time we had togetherI learned so much from Kaiabout how to truly live all the days we are given here Lessons on kindness generosity7 hope and good cheer seemed to flow freely from her daily life I think most of all she taught me that joy like love is quite contagious8and that I should always strive to be a carrier of them both May the same be said for all of us Thanks Kai aily life 		 	I

characteristic of autumn in the North Due to the abundance of trees and the low altitude of dwellings27 in Peiping cicadas are audible in every nook and cranny of the city In the South however one cannot hear them unless in suburbs or hills Because of their ubiquitous shrill28 noise these insects in Peiping seem to be living off every household like crickets or mice 	 		As for autumn rains in the North they also seem to differ from those in the South being more appealing more temperate29 	 		A sudden gust30 of cool wind under the slaty31 sky and raindrops will start pitter-pattering Soon when the rain is over the clouds begin gradually to roll towards the west and the sun comes out in the blue sky Some idle townsfolk wearing lined or unlined clothing made of thick cloth will come out pipe in mouth and loitering under a tree by the end of a bridge exchange leisurely conversation with acquaintances with a slight touch of regret at the passing of time:	 		"Oh real nice and cool"	"Sure Getting cooler with each autumn shower "	 	golden days	Fruit trees in the North also make a wonderful sight in autumn Take jujube tree for example They grow everywherearound the corner of a house at the foot of a wall by the side of a latrine or outside a kitchen door It is at the height of autumn that jujubes shaped like dates or pigeon eggs make their appearance in a light yellowish-green amongst tiny elliptic leaves By the time when they have turned ruddy and the leaves fallen the north-westerly wind will begin to reign32 supreme33 and make a dusty world of the North Only at the turn of July and August when jujubes persimmons grapes are 80-90 percent ripe will the North have the best of autumnthe golden days in a year 	 	anthology 	Some literary critics say that Chinese literati especially poets are mostly disposed to be decadent34 which accounts for predominance of Chinese works singing the praises of autumn Well the same is true of foreign poets isn't it I haven't read much of foreign poetry and prose nor do I want to enumerate35 autumn-related poems and essays in foreign literature But if you browse36 through collected works of English German French or Italian poets or various countries' anthologies of poetry or prose you can always comes across a great many literary pieces eulogizing or lamenting37 autumn Long pastoral poems or songs about the four seasons by renowned38 poets are mostly distinguished39 by beautiful moving lines on autumn All that goes to show that all live creatures and sensitive humans alike are prone40 to the feeling of depth remoteness severity and bleakness41 	 		Not only poets even convicts in prison I suppose have deep sentiments in autumn in spite of themselves Autumn treats all humans alike regardless of nationality race or class However judging from Chinese idiom qiushi (autumn scholar meaning and aged42 scholar grieving over frustrations43 in his life) and frequent selection in textbooks of Ouyang Xiu's On the Autumn Sough and Su Dongpo's On the Red Cliff Chinese men of letters seem to be particularly autumn-minded But to know the real flavour of autumn especially China's autumn one has to visit the North 	 		Autumn in the South also has its unique features such as the moonlit Ershisi Bridge in Yangzhou the flowing sea tide at the Qiantangjiang River the mist-shrouded Putuo Mountain and lotuses at the Lizhiwan Bay But they all lack strong colour and lingering flavour Southern autumn is to Northern autumn what yellow rice wine is to kaoliang wine congee44 to steamed buns perches45 to crabs46 yellow dogs to camels 	 		Autumn I mean Northern autumn if only it could be made to last forever I would be more than willing to keep but one-third of my life-span and have two-thirds of it bartered47 for the prolonged stay of the season
