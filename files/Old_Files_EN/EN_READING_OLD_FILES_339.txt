My aunt Edith was a widow1 of 50 working as a secretary when doctors discovered what was then thought to be a very serious heart ailment2  Aunt Edith doesn't accept defeat easily She began studying medical reports in the library and found an article in a magazine about a well-known heart surgeon Dr Michael DeBakey of Houston Texas HE had saved the life of someone with the same ailment The article said Dr DeBakey's fees were very high; Aunt Edith couldn't possibly pay them But could he tell her of someone whose fee she could pay  So Aunt Edith wrote to him She simply listed her reasons for wanting live: her three children who would be on their own in three or four more years her little-girl dream of traveling and seeing the world There wasn't a word of self-pity -- only warmth and humor3 and the joy of living She mailed the letter not really expecting an answer  A few days later my doorbell rang Aunt Edith didn't wait to come in; she stood in the hall and read aloud: "Your beautiful letter moved me very deeply If you can come to Houston there will be no charge for either the hospital or the operation Signed -- Michael DeBakey " That was seven years ago Since then Aunt Edith has been around the world Her three children are happily married For her age she is one of the youngest most alive people I know -- all because of an open heart surgeon who knew how to honor4 of his profession and how to open his own heart rse " she answered  "what do you want me to see " Pointing to a spot on her dress  she said  "Right here is where my mommy kissed my dress  and here " pointing to another spot  "and here is another kiss   and here  and here Mommy said that she put all those kisses on my dress so that I would have her kisses for every booboo'that made me cry " Then the lady realized that she wasn't just looking at a dress  no  she was looking at a mother who knew that she was going away and would not be there to kiss away the hurts that she knew her daughter would get  So she took all the love she had for her beautiful little girl and put them into this dress  that her child now so proudly wore  She no longer saw a little girl in a simple dress  She saw a child wrapped in her mother's love ent  They know how to handle themselves  But they're aware that that doesn't mean they can't be vulnerable or emotional  One of the reasons they feel comfortable dating is because they know how to be tough without feeling the need to apologize for having emotions  10  A good conversation in their eyes doesn't revolve4 around how much money you make or how successful you are  They're more interested in hearing what makes you tick  what inspires you  what gets your blood flowing  and what you're passionate about  11  They know that sometimes they have a hard time opening up in the beginning  They're used to being in control  so when they're not  it's a little disorienting  But they enjoy the challenge of trying to get better  so it's something they're always keen to work on  12  They won't ask you to choose between them and your other priorities  because they're too busy having priorities of their own  13  Ambitious girls are attracted to people who have goals and aspirations5 - people who want more than an average existence  They don't need you to be the CEO of a Fortune 500 or an insanely successful entrepreneur  They just want to know you care about something that matters and are willing to work for it  14  They're not going to wait forever  They'll let you know  one way or another  that they like you  They're never in a rush to jump into a relationship  but they're also practical about where they are in their lives and when it's time to move on  If you like them  do something about it  15  They're less worried about a fairytale romance and more concerned with finding someone who will simply make them happy  They're not preoccupied6 with a huge diamond ring  an over-the-top wedding  and a ridiculous love story they can tell their friends  They just want to be with someone who will love them for who they are  and never ask them to stop following their dreams
