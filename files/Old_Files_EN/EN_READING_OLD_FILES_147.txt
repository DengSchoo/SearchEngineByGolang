Dear Myself Life is scary One day you wake up feeling like you can take over the world and the next day you wake up feeling like all you want to do is to lay in bed and hide from everything People walk into your life grab your hand and lead you the most beautiful path youve known but sometimes the same people let go of your hand without warning and you become stranded at a place where you never thought yould feel lost Lets be honest sometimes everything is going so great and it seems like nothing could go wrong but right when you begin to think that something so horrible comes crashing down and all of a sudden more problems come ricocheting around you and you just feel so hopeless cause its so bad Its so hard to understand why such things happen in life and I personally wish I had an answer to that why you always ask yourself but all I can say that is no matter how hard life gets you have to keep going The life around you will never stop going on Ill be honest and say that sometimes I feel a little bit worried and all I can think is will I be able to keep up What if everything goes too fast But I realized that being scared and living with that burden of running away from problems only slow me down even more And Ive come to the point where I believe that because life never stops I shouldnt stop either Its okay to take break and to give yourself time to heal but you cannot give up and you cannot quit Keep positive fill you heart with gratitude for what you already have and always remind to humble and true to who you areWith Love Your Soulumble and true to who you are	 	With Love 	Your Soul	 	 e of a chocolate bar a section of an orange and a slice of pizza 	The important thing about units is that once we've made a new unit we can treat it just like we did the old unit 	We can compose composed units and we can partition partitioned units 	Think about toaster pastries5 	They come in packs of two and then those packs get put together in sets of four to make a box 	So when I buy one box of toaster pastries am I buying one thing four things or eight things 	It depends on the unit 	One box four packs eight pastries 	And when I share a slice of pizza with a friend we have to cut "it" into two smaller pieces 	So a box of toaster pastries is composed of composed units and when I split6 a slice of pizza I'm partitioning7 a partitioned unit 	But what does that have to do with math 	In math everything is certain 	Two plus two equals four and one is just one 	But that's not really right 	One isn't always one 	Here's why: we start counting at one and we count up to nine: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and then we get to 10 and in order to write 10 we write a one and a zero 	That one means that we have one group and the zero helps us remember that it means one group not one thing 	But 10 just like one just like a dozen eggs just like an egg 10 is a unit 	And 10 tens make 100 	So when I think about 100 it's like the box of toaster pastries 	Is 100 one thing 10 things or 100 things 	And that depends on what "one" is it depends on what the unit is 	So think about all the times in math when you write the number one 	No matter what place that one is in no matter how many things that one represents one is  and I do not want to wrong you  You tell me how much you estimate to be the price of your dream 
	“     ，         。      ，     。   ，          ？”
	 
	After a brief discussion  they agreed to the sum of 300 coins 
	         ，        300     。
	 
	Never have I made such a business deal  So much money for a simple dream of no value  How gullible8 you are  Hassan 
	“               。                   。  ，         ！”
	 
	The two friends then went under the pine tree which the wasp had shown in the dream  Jehdi was amused to see Hassan perspiring9 profusely10 and breaking his back with the shovel11  He continued on until the shovel made a dull sound as if it had struck something hard 
	                     。             ，        。        ，             ，            。
	 
	What a surprise for the two merchants when they uncovered an earthen pot full of gold coins  Before breaking it  Hassan noted12 an inscription13 near the handle: "The first of seven "
	          ：              ！       ，                 ：“   ，   。”
	 
	The first of seven  That means there should be six more pots buried Jehdi understood  starting to regret the deal he had concluded too quickly 
	“       ，            。”     ，                  。
	 
	This time both of them dug with energy and  sure enough  they found the six pots  one after another  each one filled to the brim with gold coins 
	   ，        ，  ，      ，           ，         。
	 
	Hassan built a huge inn in the city and named it The Bulgy14 Pot  He lived as a rich and satisfied man until his death 
	            ，       “  ”。         ，    。
	 
	When Hassan was alive  Jehdi often came to visit him and greeted his friend with the words  "Well  Hassan  how are you  I have come to see what has happened to my dream " And then the two comrades patted each other on the back laughing  But every time Jehdi returned home sadder  for he knew that he could never buy back his dream 
	       ，        。   ，    ：“ ，  ，   ？               。”                ，   。          ，       。     ，              。
