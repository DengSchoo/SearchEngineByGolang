Strange is our situation here upon earth Each of us comes for a short visit not knowing why yet sometimes seeming to divine a purpose From the standpoint of daily life however there is one thing we do know that man is here for the sake of other men above all for those upon whose smile and wellbeing1 our own happiness depends and also for the countless2 unknown souls with whose fate we are connected by a bond of sympathy Many times a day I realize how much my own outer and inner life is built upon the labors3 of my fellow men both living and dead and how earnestly I must exert myself in order to give in return as much as I have received My peace of mind is often troubled by the depressing sense that I have borrowed too heavily from the work of other men To ponder interminably over the reason for ones own existence or the meaning of life in general seems to me from an objective point of view to be sheer folly4 And yet everyone holds certain ideals by which he guides his aspiration5 and his judgment6 The ideals which have always shone before me and filled me with the joy of living are goodness beauty and truth To make a goal of comfort and happiness has never appealed to me; a system of ethics7 built on this basis would be sufficient only for a herd8 of cattle rd8 of cattle ibiscus 	 	When the last withered14 petal12 dropped  all the joyful15 admiration16 for the hibiscus sank into oblivion as if nothing was left  until the landscape was again ablaze17 with the red plum blossom to remind people of life's alternation and continuance  Can't it be said that life is actually a symphony  a harmonious18 composition of loss and gain 	 	Standing19 by the window lost in thought for a long time  I realized that no scenery in the world remains20 unchanged  As long as you keep your heart basking21 in the sun  every dawn will present a fine prospect22 for you to unfold and the world will always be about new hopes ught Malcolm quite so weird2  I wasn't sure if I wanted to go out in his company 
	 
	"Afterwards  I'll cook us curry3  Do you like it  "ion it is unlikely that you will know exactly what you want to do  Be willing to dive into a job that might not be a perfect fit  and learn from it  
	 
	Take risks
	 
	Your early twenties are the best time to take risks  When you are older with more responsibilities  taking risks will be much more difficult  When you are young with fewer responsibilities  however  it is easier to travel  try new things  and explore your options  Go with your gut5  and be willing to take a leap  You are in a special time in your career that you might not be able to take advantage of in the future  If you have an inclination6 to take a risky7 job  move somewhere new  or deviate8 from your path--now is the time to do it  
	 
	Be friendly
	 
	Once you graduate college  you will no longer be surrounded by your peers at all hours of the day  Meeting new people is more challenging and requires more effort than it did during college  Because of this  it's often good to remember that being friendly is the best way to meet new people  Take interest in the lives of your coworkers and people around you  and be willing to make new connections pie that you could ever find
