I cherish being around people who are totally comfortable with who they are There always seems to be an aura of love and acceptance that follows these folks around  I think it's because they've figured out one of the biggest secrets to life: The possibility of being loved and accepted grows exponentially when we can truly say we couldn't be more comfortable with ourselves  People like being around those who are comfortable with themselves because they're less threatening We all feel the need to protect ourselves from threats aimed at our insecurities  Insecurities are like open wounds and it hurts when people poke1 at them  It can be exhausting to hang around folks who constantly poke at us just to gain some kind of external validation2 through making everyone else feel smaller  My favorite thing about people who are comfortable with themselves is they need no external validation  They have discovered their worth is intrinsic and by nature something that cannot be taken away or added to based on what other people think  Ironically enough this ends up providing comfortable people with more external validation than those who feel they need it most  Because comfortable people's worth comes from within they see no point in tearing others down To them the only sensible way to speak about another is positively3  I guess when you realize your worth comes from within you might as well build others up rather than tear them down since their size is of no threat to your sense of self-worth  Plus it's a lot more fun to speak love to others and watch their eyes glow than it is to hurt someone's feelings for a cheap laugh anyway  When we become comfortable with ourselves through fully4 accepting who we are we can silence the noise our insecurities make in public situations and become more attuned5 to the wonderful reality that unfolds before us  The result is a world with fewer insecurities To me that sounds like a better world ovel but it's true Through the portrait of her family Chang paints a picture of mid-20th-century China the suffering of its people and the resilience of women everywhere  Wild By Cheryl Strayed; 315 pages Because Strayed showed us how to leave our tough destructive pasts 1 100 miles behind us  Cheryl Strayed 26 admitted herself as a total mess She righted herself by setting out to hike up the Pacific Crest8 Trail How she did it and what she learned about life love and survival of the emotional and physical sort is the subject of her moving memoir Wild  White Teeth By Zadie Smith; 464 pages Because wildly smart novels never go out of style  In her daring debut9 novel Zadie Smith takes us straight to 1970s multicultural10 London Smith's wit and audacity11 is simply irresistible12 -- as she had written entirely13 in the language of charisma14 k a swift bow and walked off stage  I smiled to myself  Valeri wasn't just a "quiet girl" She knew about wonderful books and could play the violin like nothing I'd ever heard  Like a caterpillar1 or butterfly  she was beautiful and amazing when you looked closely
