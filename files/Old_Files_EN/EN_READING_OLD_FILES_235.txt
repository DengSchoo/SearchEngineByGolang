She was six years old when I first met her on the beach near where I live I drive to this beach a distance of three or four miles whenever the world begins to close in on me She was building a sandcastle or something and looked up her eyes as blue as the sea Hello she said I answered with a nod not really in the mood to bother with a small child Im building she said I see that What is it I asked not caring Oh I dont know I just like the feel of sand That sounds good I thought and slipped off my shoes A sandpiper glided1 by Thats a joy the child said Its a what Its a joy My mama says sandpipers come to bring us joy The bird went glissading down the beach Goodbye joy I muttered to myself hello pain and turned to walk on I was depressed2; my life seemed completely out of balance Whats your name She wouldnt give up Ruth I answered Im Ruth Peterson Mines Wendy Im six Hi Wendy She giggled4 Youre funny she said In spite of my gloom I laughed too and walked on Her musical giggle3 followed me Come again Mrs P she called Well have another happy day The days and weeks that followed belong to others: a group of unruly Boy Scouts5 PTA meetings and ailing6 mother The sun was shining one morning as I took my hands out of the dishwater I need a sandpiper I said to myself gathering7 up my coat The everchanging balm of the seashore awaited me The breeze was chilly8 but I strode along trying to recapture the serenity9 I needed I had forgotten the child and was startled when she appeared Hello Mrs P she said Do you want to play What did you have in mind I asked with a twinge of annoyance10 I dont know you say How about charades11 I asked sarcastically12 The tinkling13 laughter burst forth14 again I dont know what that is Then lets just walk Looking at her I noticed the delicate fairnessof her face Where do you live I asked Over there She pointed15 toward a row of summer cottages Strange I thought in winter Where do you go to school I dont go to school Mommy says were on vacation She chattered16 little girl talk as we strolled up the beach but my mind was on other things When I left for home Wendy said it had been a happy day Feeling surprisingly better I smiled at her and agreed Three weeks later I rushed to my beach in a state of near panic I was in no mood to even greet Wendy I thought I saw her mother on the porch and felt like demanding she keep her child at home Look if you dont mind I said crossly when Wendy caught up with me Id rather be alone today She seems unusually pale and out of breath Why she asked I turned to her and shouted Because my mother died and thought my God why was I saying this to a little child Oh she said quietly then this is a bad day Yes and yesterday and the day before andoh go away Did it hurt Did what hurt I was exasperated17 with her with myself When she died Of course it hurt I snapped misunderstanding wrapped up in myself I strode off A month or so after that when I next went to the beach she wasnt there Feeling guilty ashamed and admitting to myself I missed her I went up to the cottage after my walk and knocked at the door A drawn18 looking young woman with honeycolored hair opened the door peHello I said Im Ruth Peterson I missed your little girl today and wondered where she was Oh yes Mrs Peterson please come in Wendy talked of you so much Im afraid I allowed her to bother you If she was a nuisance please accept my apologies Not at allshes a delightful19 child I said suddenly realizing that I meant it Where is she Wendy died last week Mrs Peterson She had leukemia Maybe she didnt tell you Struck dumb I groped for a chair My breath caught She loved this beach;
