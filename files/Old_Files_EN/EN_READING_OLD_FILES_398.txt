We all live in the past We take a minute to know someone one hour to like someone and one day to love someone but the whole life to forget someone  One may fall in love with many people during the lifetime1 When you finally get your own happiness you will understand the previous sadness is kind of treasure which makes you better to hold and cherish2 the people you love  When you are young you may want several love experiences But as time goes on you will realize that if you really love someone the whole life will not be enough You need time to know to forgive and to love All this needs a very big mind  When tomorrow turns in today yesterday and someday that no more important in your memory we suddenly realize that we r pushed forward by time This is not a train in still in which you may feel forward when another train goes by It is the truth that we've all grown up And we become different   If you leave me please don't comfort me because each sewing has to meet stinging3 pain  Don't forget the things you once you owned Treasure the things you can't get Don't give up the things that belong to you and keep those lost things in memory think  One lesson from affiliating15 a tree -- perhaps the greatest moral lesson anyhow from earth rocks animals is that same lesson of inherency of what is without the least regard to what the looker on (the critic) supposes or says or whether he likes or dislikes What worse -- what more general malady16 pervades17 each and all of us our literature education attitude toward each other (even toward ourselves ) than a morbid18 trouble about seems (generally temporarily seems too ) and no trouble at all or hardly any about the sane19 slow-growing perennial20 real parts of character books friendship marriage -- humanity's invisible foundations and hold-together flight
