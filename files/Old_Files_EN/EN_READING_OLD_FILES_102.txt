Alone holding an oilpaper umbrella I wander along a longSolitary1 lane in the rain Hoping to encounterA girl like a bouquet2 of lilacsGnawed3 by anxiety and resentment4 A girlThe color of lilacs The fragrance5 of lilacs The worries of lilacs Feeling melancholy6 in the rain Plaintive7 and hesitating Silently she comes closer Closer giving me A glance like a sigh;Then she floats past Like a dream Dreary8 and blank like a dream Like a lilacFloating past in a dream the girl floats past me;Silently she goes further and further To the crumbling9 wall Out of the lane in the rain In the mournful melody of the rain Her color has faded Her fragrance has disppeared Vanished into the void;Even her glance like a sigh Melancholy like lilacs Alone holding an oilpaper umbrella I wander along a longSolitary lane in the rain Hoping to passA girl like a bouquet of lilacsGnawed by anxiety and resentment lding an oil-paper umbrella 		 	I wander along a long		 	Solitary lane in the rain 		 	Hoping to pass		 	A girl like a bouquet of lilacs		 	Gnawed by anxiety and resentment 	ness How long are you going to dream about getting started How long are you going to dream about how wonderful it'll be when you DO take action And how long are you going to dream about how much of a difference it'll make to your life There's only so much dreaming you can do before you have to turn that dream into action A dream without action is a fantasy destined1 to never come true 	 	6 You've got to get over your fear of starting eventually 	 	"Have no fear of perfection  you'll never reach it "  Salvador Dali Maybe that's the reason why you've yet to get started up until this point Are you afraid What are you so afraid of anyway Is it rejection2 Being turned down Things not going the way you expect them to Are you afraid of failure Do you fear being criticized Humiliation3 Losing money Lack of support Whatever your fears might be it's time to get over it If there's one thing I've learned about facing your fears it's the fact that fear is never as bad as we believe it to be 	 	5 It's better than over analyzing4 what you want to do 	 	You know what happens when you start over analyzing something You stress yourself out You wear yourself out you worry you over think you make stuff up in your head and you over exaggerate What an imagination our brains have But seriously speaking there's only so much analyzing you can do At some point you're going to have to kick your ass5 into gear At some point you'll have to put the key in the ignition start the engine and push the pedal You can't do that with your mind 	 	4 Procrastinating6 won't get you anywhere 	 	Getting started is easy simple and doable Yet procrastinating is also easy to do Ironic7 isn't it But the truth is delaying what you've been dying to do isn't going to benefit you At best it'll hinder you in more ways than one Remember what I said earlier about what we do everyday is a habit Well If you procrastinate8 enough that habit will creep into other parts of your life as well If you procrastinate with simple things you'll procrastinate with harder things One leads to another Start small If you must but at the least you need to get started 	 	3 The last thing you want to do is regret not starting 	 	Regretting what you've done is one thing but regretting what you've never done is another Lets be honest regretting what you haven't done is so much worse Especially when it's something you're adamant9 to do You don't want to be that person who regrets it 30 years from now do you 	 	2 You can adjust your actions along the way 	 	Ready aim fire You've heard of the saying right Well what happens if you spend all your time aiming and not firing You'll never hit anything That's basically what you're doing by thinking too much and not getting started Ready fire aim should be your approach You might not get it right on the first shot but you can adjust your aim as you go along 	 	It's better to make a mistake than do nothing at all 	 	This ties in with the last point I just made I don't like to make mistakes you don't like to mistakes nobody likes to make mistakes But nobody's perfect so it's impossible not to make a mistake As great as computers and smartphones are even they can make mistakes You can't get away from it And that's OK Just be sure to get started on whatever you've been delaying for so long And when you do make a mistake learn from it and get it right the next time Then you'll be way ahead I can guarantee you that
