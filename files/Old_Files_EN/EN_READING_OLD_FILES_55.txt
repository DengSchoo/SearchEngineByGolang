	The designer is generally commissioned by the publisher or editor overseeing the title  Some publishers have creative directors  who commission (freelance) or assign (in-house) designers

	The designer is given a brief  a document that outlines the format5 (size and shape)  production schedule  information about the content and context of the book including a blurb8 (a version of what end ups on the back cover)  and passages that represent the writing style and plot  Some designers also read the full manuscript  Unless it's a math textbook

	Designers usually communicate directly with the publisher/editor  but need to respond to critical feedback from Sales/Marketing to develop a cover that communicates both the content of the book (evoking a sense of what it's about and the writing style) and the context (ensuring it looks like it belongs to its genre  and is appealing to the intended audience)

	This balance happens by showing "roughs" for different approaches  Designers usually present two to three different concepts  roughly mocked up to show how the final cover might look

	A quick design process might involve seven or eight different iterations before a final design is chosen  followed by a process of fine-tuning (make the title bigger  try a script font  Marketing wants the author in gold foil  etc)  A painful design process can involve dozens of covers; There is a record of 50 different approaches for the one cover  Excruciating

	People are often surprised how little input9 authors have in the design process  considering the cover is how their book first faces the world  It's important to consider two factors 
	                  ，               。             。
	 
	First  most authors are happy to defer10 to the publisher about how to sell as many copies of their book as possible; publishing is a commercial business and the publisher knows the market

	Second  while the design process is happening  the author is generally in the last harrowing stage of editing their manuscript and doesn't want any distraction11  This said  if an author hates a cover it will go back to the drawing board  but if everyone has done their job well this shouldn't happen

	Once the design is finalized12  digital files are sent to a production house so copies of the book can be printed  bound and delivered to the publisher's warehouse13  from where they will be shipped to bookstores when wanted
