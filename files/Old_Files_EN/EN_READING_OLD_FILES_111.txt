Life is for living according to the wellused expression: What we choose to do is up to us That may not be completely true but there is no harm in dreaming about what wed like to achieve in our life Many of us write a list of things wed like to do before we die often called a bucket list Bucket lists have been called the greatest hits of your life and have helped some people overcome anxiety which would have stopped them following their dreams Some of us may choose to write one to fill our life with exciting and new experiences from skydiving to swimming with sharks the list is unlimited1 This is something the BBC radio programme All In The Mind has been looking at It heard from a blogger called Annette White who said she made a promise to live her bucket list which continuously pushes the comfort zone to its limits and beyond it Such a list can be exciting and can indeed help you plan your life and give you focus When the BBC reporter Helen Fawkes knew she was suffering from incurable2 ovarian cancer she took comfort in drawing up a bucket list although she called it her list for living because these were things for making the most of life Sadly she was not able to achieve all of her 50 things before she died at the age of 45 Creating a bucket list can certainly give us hope but some people have argued it can be used as a coping3 strategy4 to try to control something uncontrollable death Clinical psychologist Linda Blair told the BBC that she was not really in favour of bucket lists [they take you away from the chance to be spontaneous5 Its probably true that a list can encourage people to follow someone elses idea of the perfect life And also following a fixed6 list of goals makes you less impulsive7 your aims and wishes might change as you approach the day when you finally kick the bucket But why not at least dream of what we would like to do Why not reach for the stars even if we only reach the sky Whether we want to plan it or just see what happens we dont know what tomorrow will bring so maybe we should live for today ow will bring so maybe we should live for today  e might be how the baby has turned out If you are good and happy who is to say your parents' method was wrong every single morning – no intrusions  no interruptions  no exceptions  This allows me to read around one book per week 
	 
	Consider the math: a book of around 200-300 pages takes about 5-7 hours to read on average  depending on reading speed  Blocking out one hour per day immediately puts you at one book per week for a typical-sized book at a typical reading speed 
	 
	Start Listening to Audiobooks
	 
	Before I started listening to audiobooks  I was reading about one book per week and 52 books per year  About two years ago  I implemented10 audiobooks – that put me at around 65 books per year  I don’t listen to audiobooks that much or that often  Usually  I listen to one  maybe two  in a month  But that makes a difference of 10 to 15 books over the course of a year  When I’m walking or driving  I can fit in extra reading time by listening to an audiobook instead of radio or music  When I’m working out in the gym or going for a run  I can squeeze in a few chapters  Or even when I’m cooking  I can throw on an audiobook 
	 
	Each of us have a lot more time in the day than we realize  but that time can often get frittered away if used without intention  Audiobooks are a means of using time more intentionally11 and in a manner conducive12 to a reading goal  They fill in the downtime with books and reading 
	 
	Most audiobooks are between 6 and 10 hours long  some of them push upwards of 12 to 15  But even for longer books  the total time is negligible when spread across weeks or months 
	 
	Consider the math once again: If you have a thirty-minute commute13 to work each way  that is potentially an hour per day to listen to a book  Or  if you only want to listen in the morning  for example  thirty minutes of extra reading per day remains14 excellent – you could get through nearly two  8-hour audiobooks per month at thirty minutes a day  I would be remiss15 to ignore the small faction16 of readers who do not count audiobooks as “reading ” So here is me addressing them  Personally  I do count audiobooks as reading – a book read aloud is still a book 
	 
	By implementing a regular time block for reading each day  reading turns into a habit and becomes automated17  Thinking about when you can “fit in” time to read no longer applies once it becomes a routine part of your day  Soon enough  it becomes an integral piece of your identity as well – you see yourself as a “reader” and so do others  which further motivates and compounds the habit of reading  Next  try out an audiobook  Give yourself a month to listen to one book  you’ll realize that you fly through the book much quicker than this  It’s a fun and leisurely18 way of reading more books  And who doesn’t like being read to by someone else 
	 
	With these two ideas  you and me and everyone else can actually read more books  cool—"

	Fruit trees in the North also make a wonderful sight in autumn  Take jujube tree for example  They grow everywhere—around the corner of a house  at the foot of a wall  by the side of a latrine or outside a kitchen door  It is at the height of autumn that jujubes  shaped like dates or pigeon eggs  make their appearance in a light yellowish-green amongst tiny elliptic leaves  By the time when they have turned ruddy and the leaves fallen  the north-westerly wind will begin to reign32 supreme33 and make a dusty world of the North  Only at the turn of July and August when jujubes  persimmons  grapes are 80-90 percent ripe will the North have the best of autumn—the golden days in a year

	Some literary critics say that Chinese literati  especially poets  are mostly disposed to be decadent34  which accounts for predominance of Chinese works singing the praises of autumn  Well  the same is true of foreign poets  isn't it  I haven't read much of foreign poetry and prose  nor do I want to enumerate35 autumn-related poems and essays in foreign literature  But  if you browse36 through collected works of English  German  French or Italian poets  or various countries' anthologies of poetry or prose  you can always comes across a great many literary pieces eulogizing or lamenting37 autumn  Long pastoral poems or songs about the four seasons by renowned38 poets are mostly distinguished39 by beautiful moving lines on autumn  All that goes to show that all live creatures and sensitive humans alike are prone40 to the feeling of depth  remoteness  severity and bleakness41

	Not only poets  even convicts in prison  I suppose  have deep sentiments in autumn in spite of themselves  Autumn treats all humans alike  regardless of nationality  race or class  However  judging from Chinese idiom qiushi (autumn scholar  meaning and aged42 scholar grieving over frustrations43 in his life) and frequent selection in textbooks of Ouyang Xiu's On the Autumn Sough and Su Dongpo's On the Red Cliff  Chinese men of letters seem to be particularly autumn-minded  But  to know the real flavour of autumn  especially China's autumn  one has to visit the North

	Autumn in the South also has its unique features  such as the moonlit Ershisi Bridge in Yangzhou  the flowing sea tide at the Qiantangjiang River  the mist-shrouded Putuo Mountain and lotuses at the Lizhiwan Bay  But they all lack strong colour and lingering flavour  Southern autumn is to Northern autumn what yellow rice wine is to kaoliang wine  congee44 to steamed buns  perches45 to crabs46  yellow dogs to camels

	Autumn  I mean Northern autumn  if only it could be made to last forever  I would be more than willing to keep but one-third of my life-span and have two-thirds of it bartered47 for the prolonged stay of the season
