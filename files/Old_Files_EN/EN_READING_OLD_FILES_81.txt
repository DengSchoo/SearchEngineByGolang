1 They dont talk as much as you because they know they got smart by listening 2 They know lots of things other than what theyre specialized in Theirs is the gift of a broad mind constantly fed with the stimulant of being interested in what everyone else is doing 3 They juggle home work and personal interests with dexterity and never fall back on the tired old refrain about work life balance And when theyre juggling they somehow manage to seem 100 engaged with what theyre doing on all fronts simultaneously even though you know theyre taking appropriate steps behind the scenes to make sure their lives are perfectly serenely balanced 4 They probably do social media It is not only another chance to listen but one they use to ensure they can feed their brains with things they otherwise wouldnt have come across 5 Even when things go very badly wrong theyll be smiling Smart people never get ruffled because their smart brains present them with alternatives faster than the bad stuff can happen 6 They know they are usually the smartest person in the room but they dont spend their time dwelling on that Instead they take it as a personal challenge to see if they can make everyone else the smartest person in the room too 7 If they are managers they will make every effort to get people smarter and more popular than them in their teams Theyre not threatened because they know that smartness is synergistic 8 They have hidden skills that never get rolled out until theyre needed They dont have any need to show their full capabilities for reasons of proving theyre better than others 9 They may or may not have expensive educations Youd never know just by being with them unless you had their CV in front of you 10 They never ever under any circumstances make you look stupid even though it would be easy to do so Theyve learn through bitter experience that the only thing that happens when you make someone look bad is you look bad yourself pens when you make someone look bad is you look bad yourself
