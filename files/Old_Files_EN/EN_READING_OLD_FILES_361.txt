Dreams How nice do they sound I am not talking about the dreams we have when we are asleep but about the life long aspirations1 in each one of us I am sure many or rather shoud I say all of us have goals in our lives It could be the goal to be the next millionaire or to be a popular celebrity2 Even if your goal is something small you should be proud that you do have a goal  Some never tend to think about goals in life Although this may sound as a surprise it is ture These people take life as it comes without planning and go with the flow of events in their life But again there are many who love planning for everything in their life  In fact having a goal in life would make anyone more focused and determined3 in reaching that target Wish to get a job as a web designer Your dream can come ture if you work on your dream How you might ask Start learning web-designing skills and when you're skilled you will find that you can get your desired job easily So do you see that all it takes for your goals to materialize is some work on your part I have heard some grumble4 that their dreas are just dreams and can never become true Well it all depends on what kind of goals you're aiming at If you're dying to be the next star in Hollywood but you're camera-shy and you don't know anything about acting5 your dream to make it big in Hollywood might remain as a dream But if you're very determined to make it and you're already enrolling6 yourself in agting classes and talking to experiencedacors about acting you can be pretty sure that you're already half-way there to make your dream into a reality After all if one is willing to put in the efforts their goals can become within reach  So never say that your dream will forever be a dream Go ahead plan on making that dream a reality and watch how easily you can attain7 that target  Good luck ive for them  In the same way  let our actions make us live for our self and let not expectation screw up the major portion of your lives  Let us have the freedom and will power to express our love  affection and longingness for people whenever we feel  Let us not restrict our freedom of expression just because he or she is not responding the way we want them to  Well all in all a little bit of loneliness is good for a self-analysis to keep a check over your actions  Introspection always makes you communicate with the innerself  but too much of introspection can make you scale the altitude of self pity  So show restrain at the right time
