Make sure your love is unconditional1 Make sure you love people in all kinds of weather Or else what is the use if we love a person only when he is good or she is nice When I need the people most thats when they leave me All the time So please I hope you wont be like that We always have to consider the other party your companions situation and mood Maybe hes in difficulty2 right now Thats why his mood is not so sweet Maybe she has so much work to do and so many headaches so she cannot be so darling like usual That time is the time when we need to show our most noble3 quality the way we want ourselves to be Its not that if you are sweet to that person then he will love you more Maybe he will maybe he wont But that is not the point to be good and to be noble To be good to be noble is for ourselves because we choose to be that way we want to keep being that way and we feel good about it Its not because Okay now he needs me more If I show more sympathy4 then our love will be stronger; Its not even to be considered But most of the time we fail the test When people are in most difficulty we just leave them or we are cold and indifferent5 Oh youre not nice to me All right all right ;Youll come and need me soon ; Of course they will When theyre in a better mood when everything goes better of course theyll come around But then its too late Then it is not love anymore Its just a need for each other Thats different because you are used to each other and you need each other sometimes out of habit out of convenience out of financial security6 reasons anything But its not true love asons -- anything But it's not true love s of your life Believe in your dreams and your ability to accomplish them Keep your dreams in front of you I'm here to challenge you to reach for your dream Do not be afraid to dream Never forget if you can dream it you can do it 	 	 	 at Steve  as the class spun6 around for a good look  Steve dropped his eyes and carefully examined his fingertips 	 	After that  it was war   Steve still wouldn't do his homework  Even as the punishments became more severe  he remained stubborn 	 	"Just try it  ONE WEEK " He was unmoved 	 	"You're smart enough  You'll see a change " Nothing fazed him 	 	"Give yourself a chance  Don't give up on your life " Nothing 	 	"Steve  Please  I care about you "	 	Wow  Suddenly  Steve got it   Someone cared about him  Someone  totally unattainable and perfect  CARED ABOUT HIM    	 	Steve went home from school  thoughtful  that afternoon  Walking into the house  he took one look around  Both parents were passed out  in various stages of undress  and the stench was overpowering  He  quickly  gathered up his camping gear  a jar of peanut butter  a loaf of bread  a bottle of water  and this time   his schoolbooks  Grim faced and determined7  he headed for the woods 	 	The following Monday he arrived at school on time  and he waited for Miss White to enter the classroom  She walked in  all sparkle and smiles  God  she was beautiful  He yearned8 for her smile to turn on him  It did not 	 	Miss White  immediately  gave a quiz on the weekend homework  Steve hurried through the test  and was the first to hand in his paper  With a look of surprise  Miss White took his paper  Obviously puzzled  she began to look it over  Steve walked back to his desk  his heart pounding within his chest  As he sat down  he couldn't resist another look at the lovely woman 	 	Miss White's face was in total shock  She glanced up at Steve  then down  then up 	 	Suddenly  her face broke into a radiant smile  The smartest boy in the seventh grade had just passed his first test 	 	From that moment nothing was the same for Steve  Life at home remained the same  but life still changed  He discovered that not only could he learn  but he was good at it 	 	He discovered that he could understand and retain knowledge  and that he could translate the things he learned into his own life  Steve began to excel  And he continued this course throughout his school life 	 	After high-school Steve enlisted9 in the Navy  and he had a successful military career  During that time  he met the love of his life  he raised a family  and he graduated from college Magna Cum Laude  During his Naval10 career  he inspired many young people  who without him  might not have believed in themselves  Steve began a second career after the Navy  and he continues to inspire others  as an adjunct professor in a nearby college Miss White left a great legacy11  She saved one boy who has changed many lives 	 	You see  it's simple  really  A change took place within the heart of one boy  all because of one teacher  who cared
