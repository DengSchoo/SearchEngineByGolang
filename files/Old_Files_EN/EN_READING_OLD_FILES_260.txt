"Are you wearing that " "If you're taking me out somewhere and you see me with clothes on then yes I'm wearing that This is not a hologram outfit1 under which I'm actually naked and about to get dressed in something you won't passive-aggressively tell me you don't like " Fara Greenbaum comedian3 New York City "You should smile more " "I hate when guys tell me to smile more Maybe I just got fired today Maybe I've just been walking around in 5-inch heels all day Maybe I'm just not impressed with your mesh4 t-shirt I don't tell you to do things like get a haircut But you definitely need one " -Chrissie Mayr comedian and host of Comedy at Stonewall Inn New York City "A pet peeve5 is when strangers -- always men -- tell me to smile This happens a lot on the NYC subway and no one on the subway is happy to be taking the subway While waiting for the train one day a guy asked me 'Why aren't you smiling ' and I told him 'Because I didn't push you in front of the train yet '  -Jessica Sager6 comedian New York City "You're too pretty to [FILL IN THE BLANK] " "A friend of mine encountered this pretty recently when a man came up to her after a show she was on and told her she was too pretty to use explicit7 language during her act Unfortunately this sort of comment crops up more than you'd think as well as the notion that women can't be both 'pretty and funny ' This sort of backhanded compliment is guaranteed to incite8 rage in the recipient9 because shocker I don't like being told what I can and can't do because of the way society may perceive me And no I'm not too pretty to kick your ass2 " -Nikki Black comedian Philadelphia PA "You wanna watch a movie " "I love movies But come on we all know what that means 'You wanna watch a movie ' translates to 'Let's bone ' Most sentences uttered by men can be translated to 'You wanna f--- ' Sure let's bone but you said we could watch my favorite movie You can't ask a movie lover to watch a movie unless you plan on finishing the flick10 You better be a real good fella if you're going to interrupt Good Fellas " -Jessimae Peluso comedian and star of MTV's Girl Code dive into a job that might not be a perfect fit  and learn from it  	 	Take risks	 	Your early twenties are the best time to take risks  When you are older with more responsibilities  taking risks will be much more difficult  When you are young with fewer responsibilities  however  it is easier to travel  try new things  and explore your options  Go with your gut5  and be willing to take a leap  You are in a special time in your career that you might not be able to take advantage of in the future  If you have an inclination6 to take a risky7 job  move somewhere new  or deviate8 from your path--now is the time to do it  	 	Be friendly	 	Once you graduate college  you will no longer be surrounded by your peers at all hours of the day  Meeting new people is more challenging and requires more effort than it did during college  Because of this  it's often good to remember that being friendly is the best way to meet new people  Take interest in the lives of your coworkers and people around you  and be willing to make new connections  tell you about her class  Everybody in her class wrote something every day  She encouraged the other kids who said they couldn't think of anything to write about  She helped them with their spelling  She came to me upset one day  She said you might be disappointed in her because she didn't know how to spell 'subtraction11 ' She can do that now  If you would only ask her  Her play school this summer was filled with positive reinforcement and the quiet voice of a reassuring12 teacher  I hope that her fantasy world will be translated into reality in your classroom  I know you're busy with all the things that a teacher does at the beginning of the school year  so I'll make this letter short  But I did want you to know about the night before that first day  We got her lunch packed in the Care Bear lunch box  We got the backpack ready with the school supplies  We laid out her special dress and shoes  read a story  and then I shut off the lights  I gave her a kiss and started to walk out of the room  She called me back in and asked me if I knew that God wrote letters to people and put them in their minds  I told her I never had heard that  but I asked if she had received a letter  She had  She said the letter told her that her first day of school was going to be one of the best days of her life  I wiped away a tear as I thought: Please let it be so  Later that night I discovered a note Beth left for me  It read  'I'm so lucky to have you for a dad ' Well  Beth's first-grade teacher  I think you're so lucky to have her as a student  We're all counting on you  Every one of us who left our children and our dreams with you that day  As you take our youngsters13 by the hand  stand a little taller and walk a little prouder  Being a teacher carries with it an awesome14 responsibility #p#    #e#he precious little picture is framed now and hangs in my study  Six words- one for each year of her life- that speak to me of harmony  courage  undemanding love  A gift from a child with sea-blue eyes and hair the color sand--- who taught me the gift of love
