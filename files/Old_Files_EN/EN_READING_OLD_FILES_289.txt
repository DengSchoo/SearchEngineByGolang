Life is hard and throws a lot at us at times There are circumstances that make us feel stuck and trying to find an escape Despite what's happened or where you are right now you can live a happy life on your terms Happiness starts in your mind and then in the choices you make Here are five choices that can lead you to whatever a happy life means to you  1 Finding or Creating Work that Fulfills2 You Forty plus hours is a long time to spend in work that doesn't fulfill1 you -- or worse -- work that you hate Those feelings and emotions will affect other areas of your life We live in the Information Age Never has there been a time with so much access to knowledge and opportunity to create income You can use the Internet and social media to find your dream job or start a business you're passionate3 about Use what's available to us to today to find or create work that fulfills and brings purpose to your life  2 Ending a Toxic4 Relationship or Moving Forward in a Good One Just like our work our relationships also have a tremendous effect on our life They can bring us joy or frustrate5 us into depression Relationships are hard because love is involved and love is rarely rational6 It can also be more than romantic relationships; any that are toxic can rob us of happiness We have to make a choice to purge7 negativity from our lives in any form If you have good relationships make the choice to do the work it takes to grow together  3 Stepping Outside of Your Comfort Zone It's not easy to do things that scare us or that we're not used to Growing up we were taught to follow the rules and do what society considers normal When we stay within our comfort zone we miss a huge opportunity for growth and adventure To grow as a person you have to try new things and figure out if they're right for your life Step outside of your comfort zone daily and get a blueprint8 for the kind of life that makes you happy  4 Getting Committed to a Healthy Lifestyle Your health is important to living a long and happy life Making healthy choices helps you have the energy you need to push forward and make big changes in your life What you eat affects how you feel and the attitude that you have towards yourself and the world Make healthy choices and will it will be a big contributor to your happiness  5 Never Giving into Complacency Each of us has a lot to be grateful for in life--despite of any hard situations While we should have an attitude of gratitude9 we should never confuse that with complacency You can be grateful for what you have in your life while still wanting and striving10 for more You have big dreams and goals in your mind and heart for a reason Never let complacency convince you to settle for less than you deserve  You can have an amazing year and accomplish every "resolution" you set for yourself You can live a happy life but more than that you deserve to spend each day living life on your terms Make choices every day that lead to the kind of life you want to live  team's games At graduation the coach named Daniel the team's most valuable player  His finest hour though came at a school science fair He entered an exhibit showing how the circulatory system works He sketched12 it on cardboard It was primitive13 and crude especially compared to the fancy computerized blinking-light models entered by other students My wife Sara felt embarrassed for him  It turned out that the other kids had not done their own work--their parents had made their exhibits As the judges went on their rounds they found that these other kids couldn't answer their questions Daniel answered every one When the judges awarded the Albert Einstein Plaque14 for the best exhibit they gave it to him  By the time Daniel left for college he stood six feet tall and weighed 170 pounds He was muscular and in superb condition But he never pitched another inning He found that he could not combine athletics16 with academics He gave up baseball for English literature I was sorry that he would not develop his athletic15 talent but proud that he had made such a mature decision He graduated with a "B" average  One day I told Daniel that the great failing in my life had been that I didn't take a year or two off to travel when I finished college  This is the best way to my way of thinking to broaden oneself and develop a larger perspective on life Once I had married and begun working I found that the dream of living in another culture had vanished  Daniel thought about this His Yuppie friends said that he would be insane to put his career on hold But he decided17 it wasn't so crazy After graduation he worked as a waiter a bike messenger and a house painter With the money he earned he had enough to go to Paris #p##e# The night before he was to leave I tossed in bed I was trying to figure out something to say Nothing came to mind Maybe I thought it wasn't necessary to say anything  What does it matter in the course of a lifetime if a father never tells a son what he really thinks of him But as I stood before Daniel I knew that it does matter My father and I loved each other Yet I always regretted never hearing him put his feelings into words and never having the memory of that moment  Now I could feel my palms sweat and my throat tighten18 Why is it so hard to tell a son something from the heart My mouth turned dry I knew I would be able to get out only a few words clearly  "Daniel " I said "if I could have picked I would have picked you " That's all I could say I wasn't sure he understood what I meant Then he came toward me and threw his arms around me For a moment the world and all its people vanished and there was just Daniel and me  He was saying something but my eyes misted over and I couldn't understand what he was saying All I was aware of was the stubble on his chin as his face pressed against mine And then the moment ended and Daniel left for France  I think about him when I walk along the beach on weekends Thousands of miles away somewhere out past the ocean waves breaking on the deserted19 shore he might be scurrying20 across Boulevard Saint Germain strolling through a musty hallway of the Louvre bending an elbow in a Left Bank café  What I said to Daniel was clumsy and trite21 It was nothing And yet it was everything
