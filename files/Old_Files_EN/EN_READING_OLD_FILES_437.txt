Man is the only animal that robs his helpless fellow of his country-takes possession of it and drives him out of it or destroys him Man has done this in all the ages There is not an acre of ground on the globe that is in possession of its rightful owner or that has not been taken away from owner after owner cycle after cycle by force and bloodshed  Man is the only Slave And he is the only animal who enslaves He has always been a slave in one form or another and has always held other slaves in bondage1 under him in one way or another In our day he is always some man's slave for wages and does the man's work; and this slave has other slaves under him for minor2 wages and they do his work The higher animals are the only ones who exclusively do their own work and provide their own living  Man is the only Patriot3 He sets himself apart in his own country under his own flag and sneers4 at the other nations and keeps multitudinous uniformed assassins on hand at heavy expense to grab slices of other people's countries and keep them from grabbing slices of his And in the intervals5 between campaigns he washes the blood off his hands and works for "the universal brotherhood6 of man"-with his mouth  Man is the Religious Animal He is the only Religious Animal He is the only animal that has the True Religion-several of them He is the only animal that loves his neighbor as himself and cuts his throat if his theology isn't straight He has made a graveyard7 of the globe in trying his honest best to smooth his brother's path to happiness and heaven He was at it in the time of Caesars he was at it in Mahomet's time he was at it in the time of the Inquisition he was at it in France a couple of centuries he was at it in England in Mary's day he has been at it ever since he first saw the light he is at it today in Crete-as per the telegrams quoted above*-he will be at it somewhere else tomorrow The higher animals have no religion And we are told that they are going to be left out in the Hereafter I wonder why It seems questionable8 taste  Man is the Reasoning Animal Such is the claim I think it is open to dispute Indeed my experiments have proven to me that he is the Unreasoning Animal Note his history as sketched9 above It seems plain to me that whatever he is he is not a reasoning animal His record is the fantastic record of a maniac10 I consider that the strongest count against his intelligence is the fact that with that record back of him he blandly11 sets himself up as the head animal of the lot: whereas by his own standards he is the bottom one  In truth man is incurably12 foolish Simple things which the other animals easily learn he is incapable13 of learning Among my experiments was this In an hour I taught a cat and a dog to be friends I put them in a cage In another hour I taught them to be friends with a rabbit In the course of two days I was able to add a fox a goose a squirrel and some doves Finally a monkey They lived together in peace; even affectionately
