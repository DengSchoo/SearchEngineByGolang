	My grandmother left for Aunt Lillian's a few weeks later  That night  at dinner  my mother served two of my all-time favorite foods  meatloaf and mashed14 potatoes  Along with them came a big  steaming bowl of peas  She offered me some peas  and I  in the very last moments of my innocent youth  declined  My mother fixed15 me with a cold eye as she heaped a huge pile of peas onto my plate  Then came the words that were to haunt me for years 
	 
	"You ate them for money " she said  "You can eat them for love "
	 
	Oh  despair  Oh  devastation16  Now  too late  came the dawning realization17 that I had unwittingly damned myself to a hell from which there was no escape 
	 
	"You ate them for money  You can eat them for love "
	 
	What possible argument could I muster18 against that  There was none  Did I eat the peas  You bet I did  I ate them that day and every other time they were served thereafter  The five dollars were quickly spent  My grandmother passed away a few years later  But the legacy19 of the peas lived on  as it lives on to this day  If I so much as curl my lip when they are served (because  after all  I still hate the horrid20 little things)  my mother repeats the dreaded21 words one more time: "You ate them for money " she says  "You can eat them for love "
