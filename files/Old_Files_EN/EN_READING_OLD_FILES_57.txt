to end the stigma8 about admitting to feeling lonely 	 	The BBC Loneliness Experiment also found the type of culture you live in has implications for loneliness People from cultures which tend to put a high value on independence such as Northern Europe and the US revealed they would be less likely to tell a colleague about their loneliness But in cultures where extended family is often emphasised such as in Southern Europe Latin America Asia and Africa older women in particular were at lower risk of feeling lonely tumn will of itself well up inside you  As to morning glories  I like their blue or white flowers best  dark purple ones second best  and pink ones third best  It will be most desirable to have them set off by some tall thin grass planted underneath22 here and there 	 	                                                                                 	Locust trees in the North  as a decorative23 embellishment of nature  also associate us with autumn  On getting up early in the morning  you will find the ground strewn all over with flower-like pistils fallen from locust trees  Quiet and smell-less  they feel tiny and soft underfoot 	 	                                                                                         	After a street cleaner has done the sweeping24 under the shade of the trees  you will discover countless25 lines left by his broom in the dust  which look so fine and quiet that somehow a feeling of forlornness will begin to creep up on you  The same depth of implication is found in the ancient saying that a single fallen leaf from the wutong tree is more than enough to inform the world of autumn's presence 	 	                                                                                                            	The sporadic26 feeble chirping of cicadas is especially characteristic of autumn in the North  Due to the abundance of trees and the low altitude of dwellings27 in Peiping  cicadas are audible in every nook and cranny of the city  In the South  however  one cannot hear them unless in suburbs or hills  Because of their ubiquitous shrill28 noise  these insects in Peiping seem to be living off every household like crickets or mice 	 	                                  	As for autumn rains in the North  they also seem to differ from those in the South  being more appealing  more temperate29 	 	                                                                                                                             	A sudden gust30 of cool wind under the slaty31 sky  and raindrops will start pitter-pattering  Soon when the rain is over  the clouds begin gradually to roll towards the west and the sun comes out in the blue sky  Some idle townsfolk  wearing lined or unlined clothing made of thick cloth  will come out pipe in mouth and  loitering under a tree by the end of a bridge  exchange leisurely conversation with acquaintances with a slight touch of regret at the passing of time:	 	                           	"Oh  real nice and cool "	"Sure  Getting cooler with each autumn shower "	 	                                                                                                                                                                                  golden days 	Fruit trees in the North also make a wonderful sight in autumn  Take jujube tree for example  They grow everywhere around the corner of a house  at the foot of a wall  by the side of a latrine or outside a kitchen door  It is at the height of autumn that jujubes  shaped like dates or pigeon eggs  make their appearance in a light yellowish-green amongst tiny elliptic leaves  By the time when they have turned ruddy and the leaves fallen  the north-westerly wind will begin to reign32 supreme33 and make a dusty world of the North  Only at the turn of July and August when jujubes  persimmons  grapes are 80-90 percent ripe will the North have the best of autumn the golden days in a year 	 	                                                                                                                        anthology                                                                                                          	Some literary critics say that Chinese literati  especially poets  are mostly disposed to be decadent34  which accounts for predominance of Chinese works singing the praises of autumn  Well  the same is true of foreign poets  isn't it  I haven't read much of foreign poetry and prose  nor do I want to enumerate35 autumn-related poems and essays in foreign literature  But  if you browse36 through collected works of English  German  French or Italian poets  or various countries' anthologies of poetry or prose  you can always comes across a great many literary pieces eulogizing or lamenting37 autumn  Long pastoral poems or songs about the four seasons by renowned38 poets are mostly distinguished39 by beautiful moving lines on autumn  All that goes to show that all live creatures and sensitive humans alike are prone40 to the feeling of depth  remoteness  severity and bleakness41 	 	                                                                                                                                                          	Not only poets  even convicts in prison  I suppose  have deep sentiments in autumn in spite of themselves  Autumn treats all humans alike  regardless of nationality  race or class  However  judging from Chinese idiom qiushi (autumn scholar  meaning and aged42 scholar grieving over frustrations43 in his life) and frequent selection in textbooks of Ouyang Xiu's On the Autumn Sough and Su Dongpo's On the Red Cliff  Chinese men of letters seem to be particularly autumn-minded  But  to know the real flavour of autumn  especially China's autumn  one has to visit the North 	 	                                                                                                      	Autumn in the South also has its unique features  such as the moonlit Ershisi Bridge in Yangzhou  the flowing sea tide at the Qiantangjiang River  the mist-shrouded Putuo Mountain and lotuses at the Lizhiwan Bay  But they all lack strong colour and lingering flavour  Southern autumn is to Northern autumn what yellow rice wine is to kaoliang wine  congee44 to steamed buns  perches45 to crabs46  yellow dogs to camels 	 	                                          	Autumn  I mean Northern autumn  if only it could be made to last forever  I would be more than willing to keep but one-third of my life-span and have two-thirds of it bartered47 for the prolonged stay of the season
