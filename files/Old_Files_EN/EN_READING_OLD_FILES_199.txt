You talk when you stop being at peace with your thoughts When you can no longer dwell1 in the solitude2 of your heart you will talk and the sound becomes a pastime3 And in much of your talking thinking is half murdered Thought is like a bird and once in a cage of words it can unfold its wings but not fly There are people who talk ceaselessly for fear of being alone And there are those who talk and unknowingly show a truth about themselves which they themselves do not understand And there are those who have the truth within them and know it and for that very reason dont try to put it into words When you meet a friend on the road or in a market let your spirit move your lips and direct your tongue Let the voice within your mind speak to the ear of him His soul will keep the truth of your heart just as the taste of the wine is remembered when its colour is forgotten forgotten 	 		 		 	 a session with the family physician  "Could nothing be done "	 	"I believe I could graft5 on a pair of outer ears if they could be procured " the doctor decided6 Whereupon the search began for a person who would make such a sacrifice for a young man 	 	Two years went by One day his father said to the son "You're going to the hospital son Mother and I have someone who will donate the ears you need But it's a secret "	 	The operation was a brilliant success and a new person emerged His talents blossomed into genius and school and college became a series of triumphs 	 	Later he married and entered the diplomatic service One day he asked his father "Who gave me the ears Who gave me so much I could never do enough for him or her "	 	"I do not believe you could " said the father "but the agreement was that you are not to know  not yet "	 	The years kept their profound secret but the day did come One of the darkest days that ever pass through a son He stood with his father over his mother's casket Slowly tenderly the father stretched forth7 a hand and raised the thick reddish brown hair to reveal the mother had no outer ears 	 	"Mother said she was glad she never let her hair be cut " his father whispered gently "and nobody ever thought mother less beautiful did they "ial6 the person might be  Some days ago  I listened to the audiobook of Somerset Maugham's autobiography7 The Summing Up  In a chapter he regards Edward Gibbon and Samuel Johnson's style as pompous8  Though I admire Maugham's prose  I cannot agree with his view  Probably one can label Johnson's work as pretentious9  but definitely not Gibbon's  In fact  his lucid10 style makes his works highly readable  and you can hardly believe they were written over 200 years ago  Therefore  we should be open to various ideas  but always think and determine for ourselves  As a saying goes  one man's meat is another man's poison  With that in mind  we are bound to find out our favorite writers through reading and develop our fine taste in English  72-year-old  spend all your money  Otherwise  your kids are going to do it for you  Sincerely  an 85-year-old

	I nodded stupidly  my mind racing21 for something  anything  to say to this lovely young woman  She handed me a smeared22 envelope  with MRS  P printed in bold  childish letters  Inside was a drawing in bright crayon hues-a yellow beach  a blue sea  and a brown bird  Underneath23 was carefully printed: A SANDPIPER TO BRING YOU JOY
	 
	Tears welled up in my eyes  and a heart that had almost forgotten to love opened wide  I took Wendy's mother in my arms  "I'm so sorry  I'm sorry  I'm so sorry " I muttered over and over  and we wept together 
	 
	The precious little picture is framed now and hangs in my study  Six words- one for each year of her life- that speak to me of harmony  courage  undemanding love  A gift from a child with sea-blue eyes and hair the color sand--- who taught me the gift of love
