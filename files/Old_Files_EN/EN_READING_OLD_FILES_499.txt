For all worldly things shall indeed pass When I am heavy with heartache I shall console myself that this too shall pass; when I am puffed1 with success I shall warn myself that this too shall pass When I am strangled in poverty I shall tell myself that this too shall pass; when I am burdened with wealth I shall tell myself that this too shall pass Yea verily where is he who built the pyramid Is he not buried within its stone And will the pyramid one day not also be buried under sand If all things shall pass why should I be of concern for today  I will laugh at myself for man is most comical when he takes himself too seriously Never will I fall into this trap of the mind For though I be nature's greatest miracle am I not still a mere2 grain tossed about by the winds of time Do I truly know whence I came or whither I am bound Will my concern for this day not seem foolish ten years hence Why should I permit the petty happenings of today to disturb me What can take place before this sun sets which will not seem insignificant3 in the river of centuries  And how can I laugh when confronted with man or deed which offends me so as to bring forth4 my tears or my curses Four words carry me through every adversity and maintain my life in balance These four words are: This too shall pass al energy for disasters
