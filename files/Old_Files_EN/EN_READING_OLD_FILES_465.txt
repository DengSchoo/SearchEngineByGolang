It is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles the doer of deeds could have done them better  The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arens whose face is marred1 by dust and sweat and blood; who stives valiantly;who errs2 and comes short again and again; because there is not effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows the great enthusiasms the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy3 cause who at the best knows in the end the triumphs of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least fails whiledaring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat  religion to the hublest of edifices3 and you have a sanctuary4 Add justice to the far-flung round of human endeavor and you have civilization Put them all together exalt5 them above their present imperfections add to them the vision of humankind redeemed6 forever free of need and strife7 and you have a future lighted with the radiant colors of hope lways by the clothes he wears  I am quite able to pay for this suit; I simply didn't wish to put you to the trouble of changing a large note " "I didn't mean any particular harm " he said  "but I might say it wasn't quite your affair to jump to the conclusion that we couldn't change any note that you might happen to be carrying around  On the contrary  we can " I handed the note to him  and said: "Oh  very well; I apologize " He received it with a smile  one of those large smiles which goes around all over  and looks like the place where you have thrown a brick in a pond; and then in the act of his taking a glimpse of the bill this smile froze solid  and turned yellow  I never before saw a smile caught like that  in perpetuity
