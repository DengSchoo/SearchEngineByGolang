This single stick now is ingloriously lying in that neglected corner Once it was in a forest full of sap leaves and boughs1; now in vain someone has tried to compete with nature by tying that withered2 bundle of twigs3 to its trunk It is now the reverse of what it was: a tree turned upside down the branches on the earth and the root in the air It is now handled by a maid and makes other things clean but itself dirty In the end worn out in the service of the maids it is either thrown out or used as firewood When I saw it I sighed and said within myself: surely man is a broomstick Nature sends him into the world strong and lusty He wears his own hair just like a tree with flourishing leaves and branches Later the axe5 of intemperance6 cuts off his green branches and leaves him a withered trunk and he puts on a wig4 and covers himself with powder This broomstick is proud of all the branches added to him; yet they are covered with dust Though the dust is from the finest ladys chamber7 we ridicule8 it and despise its vanity We are partial judges that is partial to our own excellencies and other mens faults n's faults 	 		 		 	iction to his long suspicion that he is king 	 	Of those women who have most successfully charmed me I remember chiefly their voices and eyes Their voices were intimate and enveloping8 The listening eyes supreme charm in a woman betrayed no concern with any other world than this warmly wrapping one round with total attention and turning one's lightest words to gold Theirs was a charm that must have continued to exist like the flower in the desert even when there was nobody there to see it 	 	A woman's charm spreads round her that particular glow of well-being9 for which any man will want to seek her out and by making full use of her nature celebrates the fact of his maleness and so gives him an extra shot of life Her charm lies also in that air of timeless maternalism10 that calm and pacifying11 presence which can dispel12 a man's moments of frustration13 and anger and restore his failures of will 	 	Charm in a man I suppose is his ability to capture the complicity of a woman by a single-minded acknowledgment of her uniqueness Here again it is a question of being totally absorbed of really forgetting that anyone else exists for nothing more fatally betrays than the suggestion of a wandering eye Silent devotion is fine but seldom sufficient; it is what a man says that counts the bold declarations the flights of fancy the uncovering of secret virtues14 A man is charmed through his eyes a woman by what she hears so no man need to be too anxious about his age: As wizened15 Voltaire once said: "Give me a few minutes to talk away my face and I can seduce16 the Queen of France "	 	But charm isn't exclusively sexual; it comes in a variety of cooler flavors Most children have it--till they are told they have it--and so do old people with nothing to lose; animals too of course With children and smaller animals it is often in the shape of the head and in the chaste17 unaccusing stare; with young girls and ponies18 a certain stumbling awkwardness a leggy inability to control their bodies But all these are passive and appeal by capturing one's protective instincts 	 	You know who has charm But can you acquire it Properly you can't because it's an originality19 of touch you have to be born with Or it's something that grows naturally out of another quality like the simple desire to make people happy Certainly charm is not a question of learning palpable tricks like wrinkling your nose or having a laugh in your voice On the other hand there is an antenna20 a built-in awareness21 of others which most people have and which care can nourish 	 	But in a study of charm what else does one look for Apart from the ability to listen--rarest of all human virtues--apart from warmth sensitivity and the power to please there is a generosity22 which makes no demands Charm spends itself willingly on young and old alike on the poor the ugly the dim the boring on the last fat man in the corner It reveals itself also in a sense of ease in casual but perfect manners and often in a physical grace which springs less from an accident of youth than from a confident serenity23 of mind Any person with this is more than just a popular fellow; he is also a social healer 	 	Charm in the end is a most potent24 act of behavior the laying down of a carpet by one person for another to give his existence a moment of honor It is close to love in that it moves without force bearing gifts like the growth of daylight It snares25 completely but is never punitive26 It disarms27 by being itself disarmed28 strikes without wounds wins wars without casualties--though not of course without victims #p##e#	 	In the armory29 of man charm is the enchanted30 dart31 light and subtle as a hummingbird32 But it is deceptive33 in one thing--like a sense of humor if you think you've got it you probably haven't
