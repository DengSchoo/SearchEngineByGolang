Why should I be a good man What a silly question I choose to be a good man because it is what makes us human It is our bottom line I choose to be a good man because I know there are times that I need help from others So I choose to give my help to others I choose to be a good man because I want to be liked I want to touch others hearts so that I wont feel so alone This world is cruel No one can survive it all alone You need love You need support You need people who cherish1 you And thats what being a good man is about I want the world to be good So I become good myself  I become good myself 	mbled against the string they seemed to say " Let me go Let me go I want to be free " they soared beautifully even as they fought the restriction4 of the string Finally one of the kites succeeded in breaking loose "Free at last " it seemed to say "Free to fly with the wind "	 	Yet freedom from restraint simply put it at the mercy of an unsympathetic breeze It fluttered ungracefully to the ground and landed in a tangled5 mass of weeds and string against a dead bush "Free at last" free to lie powerless in the dirt to be blown helplessly along the ground and to lodge6 lifeless against the first obstruction7 	 	How much like kites we sometimes are The heaven gives us adversity and restrictions8 rules to follow from which we can grow and gain strength Restraint is a necessary counterpart to the winds of opposition9 Some of us tug10 at the rules so hard that we never soar to reach the heights we might have obtained We keep part of the commandment and never rise high enough to get our tails off the ground 	 	Let us each rise to the great heights recognizing that some of the restraints that we may chafe11 under are actually the steadying force that helps us ascend12 and achieve re she spent the next week paralyzed from the neck down Ironically her biggest concern wasn't whether she would walk again but whether she would be able to audition12 for American Idol13 	 	Doctors said Kendall had central cord syndrome The pain was excruciating and required morphine to control it Sometimes it was so unbearable14 she had to bite down on a toothbrush to take her mind off it As the days dragged on feeling returned to her left side but she was still paralyzed on the right We didn't know for sure how much of her movement would ever come back 	 	I believe Kendall wanted the American Idol audition so much that she willed herself to move again One of her friends brought a microphone to the hospital and put it on her bed Every day Kendall tried hard to pick it up with her right hand It was more important for her to pick up that mic than a spoon or fork 	 	Sometimes we all cried because of the pain we witnessed But on the day Kendall walked into the stadium to audition for American Idol -- a mere15 three months after her accident -- we cried tears of joy And our tears turned into shouts when she was given a golden ticket to Hollywood 	 	As a parent you always think your child is the best ever -- that's just what parents do But after seeing Kendall perform I know she's one of the best even though she didn't make it into the Top 24 	 	Kendall is eighteen now living every day to its fullest She's recorded a CD with some of John Mellencamp's band members She's also on CMT's Music City Madness for an original song and video and is having some good success I'm absolutely sure she's going to make it big some day Kendall just puts it all in God's hands 	 	When she was a little girl trying hard to be strong she looked up at me her big eyes brimming with tears and asked me why she had to have Tourette's Syndrome My heart ached to make the world right for my child But I looked right back at her and told her the truth as I see it 	 	"Kendall God gave you a pure heart an angelic voice a strong mind and a beautiful presence With all of that he had to make it fair for everyone else " for true love to thrive
