Warning This article could be bad for your health As many of us endure the long cold winter we are tempted1 to tuck into some filling and fattening2 foods This is sometimes because it helps us to keep warm and to give us energy but often its because we need something to cheer us up And for a short while at least it makes us feel better which is why we call it comfort food The type of food that makes us feel good varies from person to person it depends on your palate and the association you have with particular tastes textures3 and smells But probably the most universally popular edible4 comforter is the biscuit Its thought this goto snack often brings back happy memories of childhood and family as well as giving us that allimportant sugary pickmeup Moving on from the sweet and sugary snacks famous chef and food writer Mary Berry knows about the kind of meals that warm us up and give us comfort in the winter She told BBC Food magazine: I think it becomes natural to think about comfort food as soon as the weather chills and the nights become darker She suggests soup and warming foods as feelgood winter treats The other thing about comforting dishes like mac and cheese noodles or pizza is they dont require culinary skills in the kitchen; they are easy to make so you can get your fix of feelgood food quickly However we often feel so good that we eat too much and even though we know the ingredients are high in carbohydrates5 sugar or salt we continue to pig out Psychologist Shira Gabriel told the BBC: We feel guilty because we dont realise that whats happening is our minds [are finding a way to trigger a really positive emotion and theyre making us eat that food to do so Maybe we should take comfort from the fact that eating certain food just makes us feel happy But for some people eating any kind of food brings joy warmth happiness and comfort  brings joy warmth happiness and comfort t t need to respond to critical feedback from Sales/Marketing to develop a cover that communicates both the content of the book (evoking a sense of what it's about and the writing style) and the context (ensuring it looks like it belongs to its genre and is appealing to the intended audience) 	//	 	This balance happens by showing "roughs" for different approaches Designers usually present two to three different concepts roughly mocked up to show how the final cover might look 	2-3	 	A process of to-and-fro between editor publisher sales and marketing continues until everyone is happy 		 	50	 	A quick design process might involve seven or eight different iterations before a final design is chosen followed by a process of fine-tuning (make the title bigger try a script font Marketing wants the author in gold foil etc) A painful design process can involve dozens of covers; There is a record of 50 different approaches for the one cover Excruciating 	7-850	 	People are often surprised how little input9 authors have in the design process considering the cover is how their book first faces the world It's important to consider two factors 		 	First most authors are happy to defer10 to the publisher about how to sell as many copies of their book as possible; publishing is a commercial business and the publisher knows the market 		 	Second while the design process is happening the author is generally in the last harrowing stage of editing their manuscript and doesn't want any distraction11 This said if an author hates a cover it will go back to the drawing board but if everyone has done their job well this shouldn't happen 		 	Once the design is finalized12 digital files are sent to a production house so copies of the book can be printed bound and delivered to the publisher's warehouse13 from where they will be shipped to bookstores when wanted 		 		 	Every year on the date of Todd's death
