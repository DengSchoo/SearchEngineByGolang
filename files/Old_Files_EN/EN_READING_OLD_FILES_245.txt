	In the eternal universe every human being has a one-off chance to live --his existence is unique and irretrievable for the mold with which he was made as Rousseau said was broken by God immediately afterwards 	 	Fame wealth and knowledge are merely worldly possessions that are within the reach of anybody striving for them But your experience of and feelings about life are your own and not to be shared No one can live your life over again after your death A full awareness1 of this will point out to you that the most important thing in your existence is your distinctive2 individuality or something special of yours What really counts is not your worldly success but your peculiar3 insight into the meaning of life and your commitment to it which add luster4 to your personality 	 	It is not easy to be what one really is There is many a person in the world who can be identified as anything either his job his status or his social role that shows no trace about his individuality It does do him justice to say that he has no identity of his own if he doesn't know his own mind and all his things are either arranged by others or done on others' sugg estions; if his life always occupied by external things is completely void of an inner world You won't be able to find anything whatever from head to heart that truly belongs to him He is indeed no more than a shadow cast by somebody else or a machine capable of doing business something Jasmine and I do not share I am glad of it  'Your father may be here soon ' I say 'Last week he said he would come ' Jasmine says nothing Her left eyelid4 flickers5 perhaps  It is two months since the incident on her father's fishing boat since she fell overboard sank became entangled6 in the nets It was some time before anyone noticed then there was panic Her father hauled her back on board and sailed for home When he finally arrived he carried ashore7 what he thought was his daughter's body  'Jasmine ' I whisper I want her to take our baited name I want her to swallow it  Fortunately there was a doctor in the village that morning a young man visiting relatives It was he who brought this drowned woman back from the brink8 he who told me her story She opened her eyes he said looked up at her father and spoke9 a single word - then sank again this time into coma10  Barracuda That is what Jasmine said  When her father visits he touches her hair kisses her cheek sits in the orange plastic chair at the side of her bed and holds her hand Like my own father he has the big brown life-roughened hands of a fisherman He too smells of the sea and pretends he is a good simple man  Jasmine We share so much we are almost one  I remember early mornings my hair touched to wake me my father lifting me half-asleep from my bed carrying me dropping me into his boat His voice rough in my ear his hands rough on my skin I never wanted to go but I was just a child He did as he wished  I remember salt water hot sun my mother shrinking on the shore I remember the rocking of the boat the screams of the gulls11  'Jasmine you have a life inside you Can't you hear it calling ' Nothing  The ward door bangs and I see Jasmine's father walking towards us carrying flowers He smiles at me  Even in death my own child had my father's smile and Jasmine's will have this man's I know it  He stops by her bed and touches her hair Something stirs deep inside me I watch Jasmine's eyelids12 waiting for her to bite self feel better by thinking that I had at least treated him better than others had  Jimmy was pleasantly interesting  Sometimes I could see in his room through his window as I passed by  He was often playing his guitar  or sitting at his desk writing  After I got the note  I wondered if he had been writing things for me  From then on I tried to see Jimmy through the window  It was my only way of looking into his world  I wondered if my admirer had ever done the same  One evening  I got a call from Christy  "I think I know who your admirer is " she shrieked13  My heart pounded  "Who " "You're not going to believe this  but I think its Russell Moore  At church I overheard14 him say you were cute  Can you believe it " There was a long silence  "Well  aren't you excited " she asked  "I guess " I said  "Who do you want it to be " she asked  I couldn't think of anyone but Jimmy so I said that I didn't know  Later that evening  I considered writing Jimmy a letter  I thought I could be an 'admirer' myself  He thinks I hate him  He thinks I’m like everyone else  What if I don't get the chance to tell him different  But I decided15 against it  I guess I wasn't as brave as my secret admirer was  It was strange  I wondered if I was falling in love with him  All of a sudden I wanted to see him  talk to him  hear his voice  I wondered why I felt that way  The next day was the day of the prom  I woke up that morning feeling nervous  I could've cared less about the dance  it was where I was going afterwards that I was thinking of  The decorations at the dance were beautiful  The music was great  But I couldn't enjoy myself  I was restless up until I left at 11:45  I began walking towards the park  Although it was May  it was a cool evening  A breeze stirred the branches of the trees  I wrapped my jacket tight around me  Then I spotted16 a small park bench where I decided to wait  Thirty minutes passed and he still hadn't arrived  Maybe no one was coming in the first place  I thought  maybe he doesn't exist  I let a few tears slip out  then told myself I wouldn’t cry  Just then I got a call on my cell phone from Christy  She sounded upset  "Marly " she shouted  "Jimmy McAllister was in an accident by the school  He's hurt really bad " "Oh my God " I exclaimed choking on tears  "I'll be right there " I tried to run  blinded by tears  I tripped a few times but finally made it back to the school  I saw that his truck had slid into a ditch alongside17 the school  They were carrying Jimmy into the ambulance on a stretcher  I don't know what made me do it  but I looked inside his badly damaged truck  Laying on the seat was a red rose  Attached to the rose was a card that read  'for Marly '
