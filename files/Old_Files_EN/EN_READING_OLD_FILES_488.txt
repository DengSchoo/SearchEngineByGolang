The day is cold and dark and dreary1; It rains and the wind is never weary; The vine still clings to the moldering wall  But at every gust2 the dead leaves fall  And the day is dark and dreary   My life is cold and dark and dreary; It rains and the wind is never weary; My though still cling to the moldering past  But the hopes of youth fall thick in the blast  And the days are dark and dreary   Be still sad heart And cease repining; Behind the clouds is the sun still shining; Thy fate is the common fate of all  Into each life some rain must fall  Some days must be dark and dreary an unknown domain8 to make a journey of adventure  It is dream that adds fullness  variety  and spice to our life and makes it worth living  I have a dream  It is d dream that is deeply rooted in human nature  I dream that one day people of all origins can live in harmony and peace without being discriminated9 against or persecuted10  The bounty11 of the earth can be shared by every single human being  Mutual12 respect will guarantee the existence and continuation of the diversity of customs and cultures  Love  sympathy  and cooperation will alleviate13 the sufferings and disasters inflicted14 upon our fellow men  Respect for basic human rights will put an end to social injustices15 and evils  When my dream comes true  all men will be truly equal  happy  and free
