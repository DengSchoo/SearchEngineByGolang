I have come to believe that a great teacher is a great artist and that there are as few as there are any other great artists It might even be the greatest of the art since the medium is the human mind and spirit  I shall speak only of my first teacher because in addition to the other things she brought discovery  She aroused us to shouting bookwaving discussions She had the noisiest class in school and she didn't even seem to know it We could never stick to the subject She breathed curiosity into us so that we brought in facts or truths shielded in our hands like captured fireflies  She was fired and perhaps rightly so for failing to teach fundamentals Such things must be learned But she left a passion in us for the pure knowable world and she inflamed1 me with a curiosity which has never left I could not do simple arithmetic but through her I sensed that abstract mathematics was very much like music  When she was relieved a sadness came over us but the light did not go out She left her signature on us the literature of the teacher who writes on minds I suppose that to a lager extent I am the unsigned manuscript of the high school teacher What deathless power lies in the hands of such a person  I can tell my son who look s forward with horror to fifteen years of drudgery2 that somewhere in the dusty dark a magic may happen that will light up the years if he is very lucky difference were 18% more likely to divorce and ones with a 10-year difference were 39% more likely  7 Resentment7 builds quickly in couples that don't tackle chores together  Over 60% of Americans say that taking care of chores plays a crucial role in having a successful marriage You'll save a lot of collective time if each person specializes in the chores they're best at e chair and closed the door behind me  Jack avoided me the rest of the week  Proposals  specs  and letters appeared on my desk while I was at lunch  and my corrected versions were not seen again  I brought cookies to the office one day and left a batch7 on his desk  Another day I left a note  "Hope your day is going great " it read  Over the next few weeks  Jack reappeared  He was reserved  but there were no other episodes  Coworkers cornered me in the break room  "Guess you got to Jack " they said  "You must have told him off good " I shook my head  "Jack and I are becoming friends " I said in faith  I refused to talk about him  Every time I saw Jack in the hall  I smiled at him  After all  that's what friends do  One year after our "talk " I discovered I had breast cancer  I was thirty-two  the mother of three beautiful young children  and scared  The cancer had metastasized to my lymph nodes and the statistics were not great for long-term survival  After my surgery  friends and loved ones visited and tried to find the right words  No one knew what to say  and many said the wrong things  Others wept  and I tried to encourage them  I clung to hope myself  One day  Jack stood awkwardly in the doorway8 of my small  darkened hospital room  I waved him in with a smile  He walked over to my bed and without a word placed a bundle beside me  Inside the package lay several bulbs  "Tulips " he said  I grinned  not understanding  He shuffled9 his feet  then cleared his throat  "If you plant them when you get home  they'll come up next spring  I just wanted you to know that I think you'll be there to see them when they come up " Tears clouded my eyes and I reached out my hand  "Thank you " I whispered  Jack grasped my hand and gruffly replied  "You're welcome  You can't see it now  but next spring you'll see the colors I picked out for you  I think you'll like them " He turned and left without another word  For ten years  I have watched those red-and-white striped tulips push their way through the soil every spring  In a moment when I prayed for just the right word  a man with very few words said all the right things  After all  that's what friends do
