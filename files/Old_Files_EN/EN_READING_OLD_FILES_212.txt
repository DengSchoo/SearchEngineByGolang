A painter hangs his or her finished pictures on a wall and everyone can see it A composer writes a work but no one can hear it until it is performed Professional singers and players have great responsibilities for the composer is utterly1 dependent on them A student of music needs as long and as arduous2 a training to become a performer as a medical student needs to become a doctor Most training is concerned with technique for musicians have to have the muscular proficiency3 of an athlete or a ballet dancer Singers practice breathing every day as their vocal4 chords would be inadequate5 without controlled muscular support String players practice moving the fingers of the left hand up and down while drawing the bow to and fro with the right armtwo entirely6 different movements Singers and instruments have to be able to get every note perfectly7 in tune8 Pianists are spared this particular anxiety for the notes are already there waiting for them and it is the piano tuners responsibility to tune the instrument for them But they have their own difficulties; the hammers that hit the string have to be coaxed9 not to sound like percussion10 and each overlapping11 tone has to sound clear This problem of getting clear texture12 is one that confronts student conductors: they have to learn to know every note of the music and how it should sound and they have to aim at controlling these sound with fanatical but selfless authority Technique is of no use unless it is combined with musical knowledge and understanding Great artists are those who are so thoroughly13 at home in the language of music that they can enjoy performing works written in any century n any century d like to go to a reading with him 	 	"Um Don't know "	 	"Amelia Turner Shortlisted for the Booker Prize last year "	 	I wanted very much to go But although I no longer thought Malcolm quite so weird2 I wasn't sure if I wanted to go out in his company 	 	"Afterwards I'll cook us curry3 Do you like it "a box 	So when I buy one box of toaster pastries am I buying one thing four things or eight things 	It depends on the unit 	One box four packs eight pastries 	And when I share a slice of pizza with a friend we have to cut "it" into two smaller pieces 	So a box of toaster pastries is composed of composed units and when I split6 a slice of pizza I'm partitioning7 a partitioned unit 	But what does that have to do with math 	In math everything is certain 	Two plus two equals four and one is just one 	But that's not really right 	One isn't always one 	Here's why: we start counting at one and we count up to nine: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and then we get to 10 and in order to write 10 we write a one and a zero 	That one means that we have one group and the zero helps us remember that it means one group not one thing 	But 10 just like one just like a dozen eggs just like an egg 10 is a unit 	And 10 tens make 100 	So when I think about 100 it's like the box of toaster pastries 	Is 100 one thing 10 things or 100 things 	And that depends on what "one" is it depends on what the unit is 	So think about all the times in math when you write the number one 	No matter what place that one is in no matter how many things that one represents one is ly not much you need in those aisles13 anding  wrapped up in myself  I strode off 
	 
	A month or so after that  when I next went to the beach  she wasn't there  Feeling guilty  ashamed and admitting to myself I missed her  I went up to the cottage after my walk and knocked at the door  A drawn18 looking young woman with honey-colored hair opened the door #p#    #e#
	 
	"Hello " I said  "I'm Ruth Peterson  I missed your little girl today and wondered where she was "
	 
	"Oh yes  Mrs  Peterson  please come in" "Wendy talked of you so much 
	 
	I'm afraid I allowed her to bother you  If she was a nuisance  please  accept my apologies "
	 
	"Not at all-she's a delightful19 child " I said  suddenly realizing that I meant it  "Where is she "
	 
	"Wendy died last week  Mrs  Peterson  She had leukemia  Maybe she didn't tell you " Struck dumb  I groped for a chair  My breath caught 
	 
	"She loved this beach; so when she asked to come  we couldn't say no 
	 
	She seemed so much better here and had a lot of what she called happy days  But the last few weeks  she declined rapidly   " her voice faltered20 
	 
	"She left something for you   if only I can find it  Could you wait a moment while I look "
	 
	I nodded stupidly  my mind racing21 for something  anything  to say to this lovely young woman  She handed me a smeared22 envelope  with MRS  P printed in bold  childish letters  Inside was a drawing in bright crayon hues-a yellow beach  a blue sea  and a brown bird  Underneath23 was carefully printed: A SANDPIPER TO BRING YOU JOY
	 
	Tears welled up in my eyes  and a heart that had almost forgotten to love opened wide  I took Wendy's mother in my arms  "I'm so sorry  I'm sorry  I'm so sorry " I muttered over and over  and we wept together 
	 
	The precious little picture is framed now and hangs in my study  Six words- one for each year of her life- that speak to me of harmony  courage  undemanding love  A gift from a child with sea-blue eyes and hair the color sand--- who taught me the gift of love
