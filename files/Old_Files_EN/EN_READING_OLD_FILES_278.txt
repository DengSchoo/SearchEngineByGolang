Secret #6: They use a notebook  Richard Branson has said on more than one occasion that he wouldn't have been able to build Virgin1 without a simple notebook which he takes with him wherever he goes In one interview Greek shipping2 magnate Aristotle Onassis said "Always carry a notebook Write everything downThat is a million dollar lesson they don't teach you in business school " Ultra-productive people free their mind by writing everything down  Secret #7: They process email only a few times a day  Ultra-productive people don't "check" email throughout the day They don't respond to each vibration3 or ding to see who has intruded4 their inbox Instead like everything else they schedule time to process their email quickly and efficiently5 For some that's only once a day for me it's morning noon and night  Secret #8: They avoid meetings at all costs  When I asked Mark Cuban to give me his best productivity advice he quickly responded "Never take meetings unless someone is writing a check " Meetings are notorious time killers6 They start late have the wrong people in them meander7 in their topics and run long You should get out of meetings whenever you can hold fewer of them yourself and if you do run a meeting keep it short  Secret #9: They say "no" to almost everything  Billionaire Warren Buffet8 once said "The difference between successful people and very successful people is that very successful people say no' to almost everything " And James Altucher colorfully gave me this tip "If something is not a "hell YEAH Then it's a "no " Remember you only have 1 440 minutes in every day Don't give them away easily  Secret #10: They follow the 80/20 rule  Known as the Pareto Principle in most cases 80% of outcomes come from only 20% of activities Ultra-productive people know which activities drive the greatest results and focus on those and ignore the rest is how we argued about getting the kind of shoes she said all the girls would be wearing We said no to plastic shoes in purple or pink or orange  Beth was worried that the other kids would laugh at her baby shoes In the end she tried the solid blue ones on and with a smile told us she always did like strap shoes That's the first-born eager to please She's like the shoes  solid and reliable How she'd love it if you mentioned those straps8  I hope you quickly notice that Beth is shy She'll talk her head off when she gets to know you but you'll have to make the first move Don't mistake her quietness for lack of intelligence Beth can read any children's book you put in front of her She learned9 reading the way it should be taught She learned it naturally snuggled up in her bed with her mother and me reading her stories at naptime at bedtime and at cuddling times throughout the day To Beth books are synonymous with good times and loving family Please don't change her love of reading by making the learning10 of it a burdensome chore It has taken us all her life to instill in her the joy of books and learning  Did you know that Beth and her friends played school all summer in preparation for their first day I should tell you about her class Everybody in her class wrote something every day She encouraged the other kids who said they couldn't think of anything to write about She helped them with their spelling She came to me upset one day She said you might be disappointed in her because she didn't know how to spell 'subtraction11 ' She can do that now If you would only ask her Her play school this summer was filled with positive reinforcement and the quiet voice of a reassuring12 teacher I hope that her fantasy world will be translated into reality in your classroom  I know you're busy with all the things that a teacher does at the beginning of the school year so I'll make this letter short But I did want you to know about the night before that first day We got her lunch packed in the Care Bear lunch box We got the backpack ready with the school supplies We laid out her special dress and shoes read a story and then I shut off the lights I gave her a kiss and started to walk out of the room She called me back in and asked me if I knew that God wrote letters to people and put them in their minds  I told her I never had heard that but I asked if she had received a letter She had She said the letter told her that her first day of school was going to be one of the best days of her life I wiped away a tear as I thought: Please let it be so  Later that night I discovered a note Beth left for me It read 'I'm so lucky to have you for a dad ' Well Beth's first-grade teacher I think you're so lucky to have her as a student We're all counting on you Every one of us who left our children and our dreams with you that day As you take our youngsters13 by the hand stand a little taller and walk a little prouder Being a teacher carries with it an awesome14 responsibility #p##e#ds to a third  where the leaves were all glittering16 diamonds  And the soldier broke a branch from each; and every time there was a loud noise  which made the youngest sister tremble with fear  But the eldest still said it was only the princes  who were crying for joy  They went on till they came to a great lake; and at the side of the lake there lay twelve little boats with twelve handsome princes in them  who seemed to be waiting there for the princesses  One of the princesses went into each boat  and the soldier stepped into the same boat as the youngest  As they were rowing over the lake  the prince who was in the boat with the youngest princess and the soldier said  "I do not know why it is  but though I am rowing with all my might we do not get on so fast as usual  and I am quite tired: the boat seems very heavy today " "It is only the heat of the weather " said the princess  "I am very warm  too " On the other side of the lake stood a fine  illuminated17 castle from which came the merry music of horns and trumpets18  There they all landed  and went into the castle  and each prince danced with his princess; and the soldier  who was still invisible  danced with them too  When any of the princesses had a cup of wine set by her  he drank it all up  so that when she put the cup to her mouth it was empty  At this  too  the youngest sister was terribly frightened  but the eldest always silenced her  They danced on till three o'clock in the morning  and then all their shoes were worn out  so that they were obliged to leave  The princes rowed them back again over the lake (but this time the soldier placed himself in the boat with the eldest princess); and on the opposite shore they took leave of each other  the princesses promising19 to come again the next night  When they came to the stairs  the soldier ran on before the princesses  and laid himself down  And as the twelve  tired sisters slowly came up  they heard him snoring in his bed and they said  "Now all is quite safe"  Then they undressed themselves  put away their fine clothes  pulled off their shoes  and went to bed  In the morning the soldier said nothing about what had happened  but determined to see more of this strange adventure  and went again on the second and third nights  Everything happened just as before: the princesses danced till their shoes were worn to pieces  and then returned home  On the third night the soldier carried away one of the golden cups as a token of where he had been  As soon as the time came when he was to declare the secret  he was taken before the king with the three branches and the golden cup; and the twelve princesses stood listening behind the door to hear what he would say  The king asked him  "Where do my twelve daughters dance at night " The soldier answered  "With twelve princes in a castle underground " And then he told the king all that had happened  and showed him the three branches and the golden cup which he had brought with him  The king called for the princesses  and asked them whether what the soldier said was true and when they saw that they were discovered  and that it was of no use to deny what had happened  they confessed it all  So the king asked the soldier which of the princesses he would choose for his wife; and he answered  "I am not very young  so I will have the eldest " -- and they were married that very day  and the soldier was chosen to be the king's heir1
