Many people come to us in our lives But most of them are just trivial passangers They show up here and there now and then But they never really know us They never succeeded in opening the gate of our hearts Ones time is limited And we should spend it in the things and people that are really worth our devotion So dont waste your precious time in maintaining those unnecessary relationships Find your own world Find your own happiness Solitude1 will make your heart and mind stronger And it will make you see the world more clearly It will make you see yourself more clearly When you have this clearer view of yourself youll know better what suits you and what you really want Then you have become a true warrior2 in this battlefield called life You no longer need most of these faceless people You can be fine all by yourself And if there are still a few people remaining around you they are the ones that you truly need Cherish them they deserve you rish them they deserve you 	 shoes 	 	5 In an emergency evacuation you must leave all personal belongings3 behind Carry-on bags will slow your exit and create a hazard for you and others Don't wait for others to move; many will be paralysed by fear Get yourself out regardless of what others are doing 	 	6 Listen to the instructions of the cabin crew and follow their commands Their purpose is to protect you 	 	7 Avoid travelling by road at night - you significantly increase your chances of an accident after dark In developing countries road lighting4 may be non-existent and often vehicles either don't have working lights or don't use them 	 	8 Check whether there are proper seat belts If there are not find another seat - or better still another vehicle 	 	9 If travelling alone in a taxi always sit directly behind the driver and never in the front seat If his intentions are not bona fide sitting directly behind him makes you less accessible and gives you a better chance of fleeing the vehicle if necessary 	 	10 If you are unsure about anything however it is well worth seeking medical advice before setting off Bear in mind that some vaccinations5 can't be given to people with certain medical conditions There are also some diseases which can't be vaccinated6 against 	 	11 In recent times viruses like Ebola and Zika have made headline news sweeping7 through certain parts of the world It's therefore vital that you check on the latest advice for your destination with your GP's surgery or the Foreign Office 	 	12 That said the most common infectious illness to affect travellers is diarrhoea mainly caused by food and water-borne agents Make sure you tell your doctor exactly where you are going as in certain regions some bacteria have developed a resistance to antibiotics8 with some roaning and a tiny white spot on his rump  He was perfect  of course  and I fell in love immediately  We boarded him at the riding stable and I began taking lessons  I wanted to be the best I could be and I swelled8 with pride every time I got on Sequoia  It truly was a dream come true  I learned to brush him  saddle him  pick his hooves out  Each week I could not wait for Saturday and my lesson  then my free time with my Sequoia  When I was in Sequoia's presence  I forgot all about my problems and felt strong and secure 	 	As I see it  horses are silent too  but they are fast  powerful and free at the same time  Horses give me the strength I lack  They give me a reason to push myself  when I can find no other  Horses have been part of my life for well over twenty years now  all the while helping9 me deal with an isolating10  frightening disorder  When things get difficult  as they still sometimes do  I go to my horses  With them  I can be silent  but I can hold my head up and have dignity and freedom  By connecting with them  I have learned to embrace what I was once shunned11 for and I found my voice 	 	I am a fully4 participating member of society these days  My horses and I made it through a master's degree and then law school  I am a practicing attorney  I even make court appearances  I may have made it otherwise  but I'm not sure  I feel I owe my life to the horse and I try to give it back to them every day  I am fortunate that I can look out my back door and see my beautiful horses looking back at me  I am so grateful that I get to watch them run in their mountain pasture every day  I hope I never stop learning from them  They have given me the best gift I could ever imagine  my life  enough to go to Paris 
	 
	The night before he was to leave  I tossed in bed  I was trying to figure out something to say  Nothing came to mind  Maybe  I thought  it wasn't necessary to say anything #p#    #e#
	 
	What does it matter in the course of a life-time if a father never tells a son what he really thinks of him  But as I stood before Daniel  I knew that it does matter  My father and I loved each other  Yet  I always regretted never hearing him put his feelings into words and never having the memory of that moment  Now  I could feel my palms sweat and my throat tighten14  Why is it so hard to tell a son something from the heart  My mouth turned dry  and I knew I would be able to get out only a few words clearly 
	 
	"Daniel " I said  "if I could have picked  I would have picked you "
	 
	That's all I could say  I wasn't sure he understood what I meant  Then he came toward me and threw his arms around me  For a moment  the world and all its people vanished  and there was just Daniel and me in our home by the sea 
	 
	He was saying something  but my eyes misted over  and I couldn't understand what he was saying  All I was aware of was the stubble on his chin as his face pressed against mine  And then  the moment ended  I went to work  and Daniel left a few hours later with his girlfriend 
	 
	That was seven weeks ago  and I think about him when I walk along the beach on weekends  Thousands of miles away  somewhere out past the ocean waves breaking on the deserted15 shore  he might be scurrying16 across Boulevard Saint Germain  strolling through a musty hallway of the Louvre  bending an elbow in a Left Bank café 
	 
	What I had said to Daniel was clumsy and trite17  It was nothing  And yet  it was everything
