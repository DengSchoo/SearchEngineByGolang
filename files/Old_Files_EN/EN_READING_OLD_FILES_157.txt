Jehdi and Hassan were two merchants who were very close friends Jehdi was a cheerful person whereas Hassan was very serious perhaps too cautious and careful But an unbreakable bond of friendship tied them together and this made their journey in business a happy one for they never had any disputes One time they started together toward the city of Touria They arrived at the outskirts1 of a forest where the big trees moist rocks and cool shade invited them to take a welldeserved rest Within a minute Jehdi fell asleep Hassan looked at his friend with a sigh and told himself He sleeps peacefully in nature as if he were in his own house I am afraid of someone robbing me Even though the thief might get very little I am too apprehensive2 and I prefer to be cautious After all one never knows what might happen Hassan was ruminating3 over his anxiety when suddenly he saw a wasp4 coming out of Jehdis left nostril5 Its enigmatic dance surprised him It flew toward a single pine tree standing6 on a rock circled the tree three times and then returned to the sleeping Jehdi and disappeared into his right nostril Just at that moment Jehdi woke up sat up laughing and said Hassan you will never believe me I just had a marvelous dream Just imagine that there is big pine tree standing on a high rock exactly like the one you see there A wasp droned around the trunk and it swings buzzed as if to say You must dig in this place You must dig in this place I started digging and found a big pot full of gold coins I have never in my life seen so much money Yes truly it is a strange dream replied Hassan If I were in your place I would have dug around the pine tree there My poor friend how naive7 you are I would never take a dream seriously It is so hot here To dig would be torture Please let us continue our journey But Hassan insisted Jehdi a dream like this surely has a meaning If you do not want to dig I will try instead Do you know what I propose to you Sell your dream to me Jehdi began laughing loudly This is a good piece of business for me How much will you pay You have said that there is a big pile of gold coins I am your friend and I do not want to wrong you You tell me how much you estimate to be the price of your dream After a brief discussion they agreed to the sum of 300 coins 300Never have I made such a business deal So much money for a simple dream of no value How gullible8 you are Hassan The two friends then went under the pine tree which the wasp had shown in the dream Jehdi was amused to see Hassan perspiring9 profusely10 and breaking his back with the shovel11 He continued on until the shovel made a dull sound as if it had struck something hard What a surprise for the two merchants when they uncovered an earthen pot full of gold coins Before breaking it Hassan noted12 an inscription13 near the handle: The first of seven The first of seven That means there should be six more pots buried Jehdi understood starting to regret the deal he had concluded too quickly This time both of them dug with energy and sure enough they found the six pots one after another each one filled to the brim with gold coins Hassan built a huge inn in the city and named it The Bulgy14 Pot He lived as a rich and satisfied man until his death When Hassan was alive Jehdi often came to visit him and greeted his friend with the words Well Hassan how are you I have come to see what has happened to my dream And then the two comrades patted each other on the back laughing But every time Jehdi returned home sadder for he knew that he could never buy back his dream  on the back laughing But every time Jehdi returned home sadder for he knew that he could never buy back his dream 	 	  connected  Later that day  I could not help myself and I went out and bought aome white roses and took them to the funeral home where the yough woman was  And there she was holding a lovely white rose  the beautiful doll  and the picture of the little boy in the store  I left there in tears  thier life changed forever  The love that little boy had for his little sisiter and his mother was overwhel  And in a split8 second a drunk driver had ripped9 the life of that little boy to pieces as been loved or is now in love; every old man is rich with experiences and every child fresh; every dog is animated19 and every pigeon keen

	Every morning I do the same thing  although I am now different from before  always dreaming of unusual encounters and always wishing to inspire fervent20 passions  yet always being fooled by peevish21 reality and awakened22 from fanatical visions by such unusual weather  like today  I am now no longer lonely  Right

	This loneliness is like a padded cotton quilt  spread out high in the sky  It can be depressing  descending23  entwining  or uplifting  depending on the change in the number of people who share my room  Beautiful  isn't it  Yes  but a little cruel  I know
