I've opened the curtain of my east window here above the computer and I sit now in a holy theater before a sky-blue stage A little cloud above the neighbor's trees resembles Jimmy Durante's nose for a while then becomes amorphous1 as it slips on north Other clouds follow: big and little and tiny on their march toward whereness Wisps of them lead or droop2 because there must always be leading and drooping3  The trees seem to laugh at the clouds while yet reaching for them with swaying branches Trees must think that they are real rooted somebody and that perhaps the clouds are only tickled4 water which sometimes blocks their sun But trees are clouds too of green leaves - clouds that only move a little Trees grow and change and dissipate like their airborne cousins  And what am I but a cloud of thoughts and feelings and aspirations5 Don't I put out tentative mists here and there Don't I occasionally appear to other people as a ridiculous shape of thoughts without my intending to Don't I drift toward the north when I feel the breezes of love and the warmth of compassion6  If clouds are beings and beings are clouds are we not all well advised to drift - to feel the wind tucking us in here and plucking us out there Are we such rock-hard bodily lumps as we imagine  Drift let me Sing to the sky will I one in many are we Let us breathe the breeze and find therein our toots in the spirit  I close the curtain now feeling broader fresher The act is over Applause is sweeping7 through the trees or many people to express  Anger is best expressed physically  especially if you have a lot of repressed anger to process  Choose a physical activity that will not harm another person or yourself  Some good ways to express anger include punching pillows  hitting the ground with a baseball bat  popping balloons  taking a kickboxing class or going for a brisk walk  Cry out your pain  Tears really do heal a wounded spirit  However  many people have a hard time expressing their sorrow  Try watching a sad movie and allowing yourself to cry for the characters  Set aside time to let yourself "wallow" for a little while  You will feel much better after a good cry Comfort your terror  Many people who suffered from trauma5 in childhood struggle with feelings of terror  Comfort yourself through those feelings  Visualize6 yourself comforting the child you once were  See yourself wrapping a thick blanket around your terrified inner child and hold that child close to your heart  Laugh without reservation  A good laugh can be incredibly healing  Do not stifle7 your joy  Instead  express your joy by giving in to an urge to laugh  A good belly8 laugh can do wonders for a person's emotional state
