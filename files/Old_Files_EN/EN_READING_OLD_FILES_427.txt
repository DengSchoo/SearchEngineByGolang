It doesn't interest me what you do for a living I want to know what you ache for and if you dare to dream of meeting your heart's longing1  It doesn't interest me how old you are I want to know if you will risk looking like a fool for love for your dreams for the adventure of being alive  It doesn't interest me what planets are squaring your moon I want to know if you have touched the center of your own sorrow if you have been opened by life's betrayals or have become shriveled and closed from fear of further pain  It doesn't interest me if the story you're telling me is true I want to know if you can disappoint another to be true to yourself; if you can bear the accusation2 of betrayal and not betray your own soul if you can be faithful and therefore be trustworthy  It doesn't interest me to know where you live or how much money you have I want to know if you can get up after a night of grief and despair weary and bruised3 to the bone and do what needs to be done for the children  It doesn't interest me where or what or with whom you have studied I want to know what sustains you from the inside when all else falls away I want to know if you can be alone with yourself and if you truly like the company you keep in the empty moments  It doesn't interest me who you are how you came to be here I want to know if you will stand in the center of the fire with me and not shrink back  I want to know if you can sit with pain without moving to hide it  I want to know if you can be with joy mine or your own if you can dance with wildness and let the ecstasy4 fill you to the tips of your fingers and toes without cautioning us to be careful be realistic or to remember the limitations of being human  I want to know if you can see beauty if you can source your life from gods presence I want to know if you can live with failure yours and mine and still stand on the edge of a lake and shout to the silver of the full moon "Yes ""nimals have no religion  And we are told that they are going to be left out  in the Hereafter  I wonder why  It seems questionable8 taste  Man is the Reasoning Animal  Such is the claim  I think it is open to dispute  Indeed  my experiments have proven to me that he is the Unreasoning Animal  Note his history  as sketched9 above  It seems plain to me that whatever he is he is not a reasoning animal  His record is the fantastic record of a maniac10  I consider that the strongest count against his intelligence is the fact that with that record back of him he blandly11 sets himself up as the head animal of the lot: whereas by his own standards he is the bottom one  In truth  man is incurably12 foolish  Simple things which the other animals easily learn  he is incapable13 of learning  Among my experiments was this  In an hour I taught a cat and a dog to be friends  I put them in a cage  In another hour I taught them to be friends with a rabbit  In the course of two days I was able to add a fox  a goose  a squirrel and some doves  Finally a monkey  They lived together in peace; even affectionately
