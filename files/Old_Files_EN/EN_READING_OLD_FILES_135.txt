What makes me argry Mostlyl hate when someone tries to make someone else feel bad I have to admit that once when l was actually called names l regretted doing this afterwards but not full heartedly because l think l was provoked1 in that situation The most postive way of dealing2 with anger is talking about the problem l talk to someone who listens or lll write my thoughts down on paper Learning3 how to deal with anger as youre growing up is so important When youre younger you might yell or cry when youre angry but as you get older youre expected to handle your emotions much better Learning to control your emotion now will prevent you from doing something that youll regret later on in life something that you'll regret later on in life 		 	At times it will be for one parent and later without any rhyme or reason it can switch to the other parent 	 	As long as there's not something in your relationship with your son that might be causing the distance (ie lack of time together lack of affection anything that might be effecting a strong bond forming) then don't worry your time will come  going on 	 	I'll be honest and say that sometimes I feel a little bit worried and all I can think is "will I be able to keep up  What if everything goes too fast " But I realized that being scared and living with that burden of running away from problems only slow me down even more 	 	And I've come to the point where I believe that because life never stops  I shouldn't stop either  It's okay to take break and to give yourself time to heal  but you cannot give up and you cannot quit 	 	Keep positive  fill you heart with gratitude for what you already have  and always remind to humble and true to who you are 	 	With Love 	Your Soul	 g man is called Tony Wheeler  and the Irish girl is Mauren Wheeler
