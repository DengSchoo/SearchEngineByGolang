Remember my son you have to work Whether you handle a pick or a pen a wheel-barrow or a set of books digging ditches or editing a paper ringing an auction1 bell or writing funny things you must work If you look around you will see the men who are the most able to live the rest of their days without work are the men who work the hardest Don't be afraid of killing2 yourself with overwork It is beyond your power to do that on the sunny side of thirty They die sometimes but it is because they quit work at six in the evening and do not go home until two in the morning It's the interval3 that kills my son The work gives you an appetite for your meals; it lends solidity to your slumbers4 it gives you a perfect and grateful appreciation5 of a holiday Â There are young men who do not work but the world is not proud of them It does not know their names even it simply speaks of them as "old So-and-So's boy" Nobody likes them; the great busy world doesn't know that they are there So find out what you want to be and do and take off your coat and make a dust in the world The busier you are the less harm you will be apt to get into the sweeter will be your sleep the brighter and happier your holidays and the better satisfied will the world be with you greatest moral lesson anyhow from earth  rocks  animals  is that same lesson of inherency  of what is  without the least regard to what the looker on (the critic) supposes or says  or whether he likes or dislikes  What worse -- what more general malady16 pervades17 each and all of us  our literature  education  attitude toward each other  (even toward ourselves ) than a morbid18 trouble about seems  (generally temporarily seems too ) and no trouble at all  or hardly any  about the sane19  slow-growing  perennial20  real parts of character  books  friendship  marriage -- humanity's invisible foundations and hold-together
