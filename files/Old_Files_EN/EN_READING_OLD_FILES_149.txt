Recently one of Ms friend was about to graduate He had been looking for a job and he came to M for advice MMThis friend of Ms now works as an intern1 in a public institution This institution deals with international trades and provides a lot opportunities of international communication And they pay the employees nicely MBesides it has a feature that most public institutions share: leisure The jobs are ninetofive and you rarely work overtime2 there You can say that its many peoples dream workplace And the most thrilling part is that the institution wants this friend of Ms to become a regular employee They offered him to stay MBut whats astonishing is that this friend turned them off MAnd this is why he came to M MHe was afraid that he would lose his competitiveness in such a secured environment He was afraid that he would become the frog He thought he should find a place with fiercer competition and acquire abilities there And for the payment part though what the institution offered is way higher than what most fresh graduates can get but he had heard about the surprisingly high starting salary that BAT pay their employees BATSo he confidently thought that he could certainly find a better job However he does not have any other offer at hand offerThis beautiful future is just his imagination so far M was nearly scared to death when he heard this MHe was originally planing to persuade this friend to stay there But fortunately there are still several months left before the friends internship3 ends And anyway it was the institution which proposed the job in the first place So there is still a chance for him to turn back Yes if you examine all those success books and industry legends you would find a lot of successful cases which were born under great risks The spirit of adventure seems to have become something worshiped by the whole society On the other hand a stable job is usually despised by people They think it shows a persons lack of ambition and even lack of merits But all these successful cases born under great risks are just like the thought that you grow faster in severe competition They are both survivor4 bias5 The ones who can show up in front of you and tell you this are the minority who survived Most of the others have already died and disappeared They dont have the chance to come and warn you Yes this is the current job market Many young people who came to the firsttier cities ended up in devastating6 failures And you wont know these peoples stories ailures 		And you wont know these peoples stories 	r found yourself stuck in a waiting room  bored out of your mind  with nothing to read but gossip magazines  If so  you should know that it is wise to keep a book in your purse or car at all times  as you never know when you'll find yourself with some time to kill  Even if you just take a few minutes to read a chapter during your commute10 and lunch break every day  those minutes will quickly turn into hours if repeated consistently 
	 
	9  You will strengthen your patience muscles
	 
	We live in a society that expects instant gratification  which is anything but a blessing11 for most people's success in life  as there is nothing "quick" or "easy" about losing weight or starting a successful business  While it might be "easier" to watch a two-hour movie  it is far more beneficial to spend forty-eight hours reading a book  Opting12 for the book over the TV will strengthen your patience muscles over time  resulting in more success in business and life 
	 
	10  You will become an expert in your field
	 
	Don't you think reading academic journals  articles  and books by experts in your field might make you better at what you do  If you can't be bothered to learn more about your profession  then your lack of passion could be a sign that you're in the wrong field 
	 
	11  You will reduce stress and unwind into a good night's sleep
	 
	Exposing yourself to artificial light on your cellphone  TV or tablet reduces your body's production of melatonin  which can make it difficult to get a good night's sleep  if you do so late at night  You would be wise to cut off all electronics at least an hour before bed  and replace that with a good book  which is a much better sleep-friendly alternative 
	 
	12  You will change your life
	 
	I firmly believe that if it wasn't for books  I wouldn't have achieved an awful lot in my life; nor would I have the knowledge  imagination or creativity that I depend on as a writer  business owner  and coach  I hope these reasons to read more books encourage you to unlock your potential with the power of reading
