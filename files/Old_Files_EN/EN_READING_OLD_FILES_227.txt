1 You never do the dishes You always just leave them sitting there The dishes are a placeholder for pretty much anything here Whatever the issue using accusatory blanket terms like never and always tends to end the same way every time: with you and your boo engaged in an overblown argument Plus theres a good chance your generalization1 is wrong said Samantha Rodman a psychologist in Takoma Park Maryland 2 You sound exactly like your mother When arguing stick to the issue at hand and keep the focus on the two of you Introducing nasty comparisons to your inlaws is unfair and ultimately a diversion from your problems said Sharon Gilchrest ONeill a marriage and family therapist and the author of A Short Guide to a Happy Marriage 3 You think youre better than everyone else Never put words in your partners mouth or in this case thoughts in their head Theres no way of knowing what someone is feeling or thinking so keep the assumptions to yourself said Becky Whetstone a marriage and family therapist in Little Rock Arkansas 4 Do I look like Ive put on weight What you really mean by asking this is I know Ive put on weight Im unhappy about how I look and I need you to say that youre OK with my current state she said These types of questions are all about sidestepping personal responsibility plus they force your partner into an enabling role said Robyn Wahlgast a dating and relationship coach for women 5 Have you put on a few pounds Blunt negative remarks to your spouse2 about his or her appearance are also out of line 6 Youre a horrible parent breadwinner lover Putdowns centered around your spouses family or occupational roles are particularly cruel said M Gary Neuman a psychotherapist based in Miami Beach Florida 7 Ugh I hate when you do that Said in front of friends or family Putting your spouse down in front of others is a huge nono in a relationship said Whetstone 8 I barely know him hes just someone I work with Its almost inevitable3 that you or your partner will develop a small innocent crush on someone at some point during your marriage If that happens be upfront about it Dont try to sweep it under the rug with a statement that minimizes your feelings said Wahlgast Though it may be an uncomfortable subject to broach4 ultimately Wahlgast said being transparent5 about your feelings will create more openness with your partner Youll each feel more comfortable bringing up other taboo6 subjects in a kind and respectful way 9 You shouldnt feel that way Theres nothing more belittling7 or condescending8 than telling your spouse what he should or shouldnt be feeling in any given situation Rodman said 10 Dont wait up for me This seemingly innocent remark suggests youre not going to bed at the same time a habit that can be damaging to your relationship said Wahlgast This seemingly innocent remark suggests you're not going to bed at the same time a habit that can be damaging to your relationship said Wahlgast  dock  never swaying from his pleasantries  And  for once  Mom forgets about making dinner 
	 
	It is a day of memories  a day never to be forgotten 
	 
	My three children are in the photo  and Dad is in the background  as are two of my sisters and their children  but everyone who gazes at the poorly developed photo is drawn19 inexplicably20 to Mom's smile  In the photo  her face is raised up to the sky  To the sun or to our Creator  she alone knows  Her eyes are closed 
	 
	I remember how warm it was that day and how she had squinted21 up at me  shielding her eyes with both hands 
	 
	"Are my legs getting red " she'd asked 
	 
	My eyes brim with unshed tears as I remember the feel of her skin on the palm of my hand  Hot  The scalding tears run down my face  How I wish I could touch her one more time 
	 
	"No  Mom " I replied  "But better put some sunscreen on before you get a burn " Reluctantly  she'd sat up  the peaceful smile disappearing  and rolled her pant legs down  again 
	 
	"Save it for the kids " she said  her eyes scanning the group of children splashing in and out of the water  The whisper of a smile touched her lips as she watched for a long  wistful moment  With a sigh  she rose from the chair and moved toward the car where the coolers awaited 
	 
	"Maybe we should get lunch going " she said as she opened the first cooler 
	 
	Now it is my turn to smile  Mom was not ready to relinquish22 dinner duties  after all  On a whim23  I turn my face heavenward and close my eyes  I draw a deep breath and search for the special place Mom found that afternoon  It comes to me easily  Without pomp or ceremony  there she is  smiling again  Tears squeeze from beneath my closed lids  and I fervently24 pray that anyone who might come upon me at this moment will say my smile reminds them of Mom's smile  that day on the beach so long ago  Tender  sweet  unassuming - and despite our loss it was peaceful  Wendy's mother in my arms  "I'm so sorry  I'm sorry  I'm so sorry " I muttered over and over  and we wept together 
	 
	The precious little picture is framed now and hangs in my study  Six words- one for each year of her life- that speak to me of harmony  courage  undemanding love  A gift from a child with sea-blue eyes and hair the color sand--- who taught me the gift of love
