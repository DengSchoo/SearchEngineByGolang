You spend years trying to get them off the ground  You run with them until you're both breathless  They crash  They hit the rooftop  You patch comfort  and sure that someday they would fly Finally they are airborne    They need more string and you keep letting it out  They talk and the each twist of the twine1 there is a sadness that goes with joy  The kite becomes more distant  and you know it won't be long before that beautiful creature will snap the lifeline that binds2 you two together and will soar as it is meant to soar  free and alone  Only then do you know that you did your job e to speak; a time to love and a time to hate; a time of war and a time of peace
