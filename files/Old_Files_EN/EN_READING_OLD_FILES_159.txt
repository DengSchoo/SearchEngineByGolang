Once a circle missed a wedge The circle wanted to be whole so it went around looking for its missing piece But because it was incomplete and therefore could roll only very slowly it admired the flowers along the way It chatted with worms It enjoyed the sunshine It found lots of different pieces but none of them fit So it left them all by the side of the road and kept on searching Then one day the circle found a piece that fit perfectly1 It was so happy Now it could be whole with nothing missing It incorporated the missingpiece into itself and began to roll Now that it was a perfect circle it could roll very fast too fast tonotice the flowers or talking to the worms When it realized how different the world seemed when it rolled so quickly it stopped left its found piece by the side of the road and rolled slowly away The lesson of the story I suggested was that in some strange sense we are more whole when we are missingsomething The man who has everything is in some ways a poor man He will never know what it feels like to yearn2 to hope to nourish his soul with the dream of something better He will never know the experience ofhaving someone who loves him give him something he has always wanted or never had There is a wholeness about the person who has come to terms with his limitations who has been brave enough to let go of his unrealistic dreams and not feel like a failure for doing so There is a wholeness about the man or woman who has learned that he or she is strong enough to go through a tragedy and survive who can lose someone and still feel like a complete person Life is not a trap set for us by God so that he can condemn3 us for failing Life is not a spelling bee where no matter how many words youve gotten right youre disqualified if you make one mistake Life ismore like a baseball season where even the best team loses onethird of its games and even the worst team has its days of brilliance4 Our goal is to win more games than we lose When we accept that imperfection is part of being human and when we can continue rolling through life andappreciate it we will have achieved a wholeness that others can only aspire5 to That I believe is what God asks of us not Be perfect not Dont even make a mistake but Be whole If we are brave enough to love strong enough to forgive generous enough to rejoice in anothers happiness and wise enough to know there is enough love to go around for us all then we can achieve a fulfillmentthat no other living creature will ever know living creature will ever know  doll He softly said "Thank you Jesus for giving me enough money " Then the boy said "I just asked Jesus to give me enough money to buy this doll so Mama can take it with her to give my sister And he heard my prayer I wanted to ask him give for enough to buy my Mama a white rose but I didn't ask him but he gave me enough to buy the doll and a rose for my Mama She loves white rose so much "In a few minutes the aunt came back and I wheeled my cart away 	 	I could not keep from thinking about the little boy as I finished my shoppong in a ttally different spirit than when I had started And I kept remembering a story I had seen in the newspaper several days earlier about a drunk driver hitting a car and killing7 a little girl and the Mother was in serious condition The family was deciding on whether to remove the life support Now surely this little boy did not belong with that story 	 	Two days later I read in the paper where the family had disconnected the life support and the young woman had died I could not forget the little boy and just kept wondering if the two were somehow connected Later that day I could not help myself and I went out and bought aome white roses and took them to the funeral home where the yough woman was And there she was holding a lovely white rose the beautiful doll and the picture of the little boy in the store I left there in tears thier life changed forever The love that little boy had for his little sisiter and his mother was overwhel And in a split8 second a drunk driver had ripped9 the life of that little boy to pieces       ，           ，                  ，
