The silent young woman in bed number six is called Jasmine So am I but names are only superficial things floats bobbing on the surface of the water and we share deeper connections than that Which is why she fascinates me - why I spend my off-duty time sitting beside her  Today is difficult The ward1 heaves with patients and I am kept busy emptying bed-pans filling out forms changing dressings2 Finally late in the afternoon I get a few moments to make coffee to take it over to the orange plastic chair beside her bed I am thankful to be off my feet glad to be in her company once again  'Hello Jasmine ' I say as if greeting myself  She does not reply Jasmine never replies She is down too deep  Like me she has been sea-damaged I too am the daughter of a fisherman so I bait my words like fish-hooks cast them into her ears imagine them sinking down through cold dark water Down to wherever she may be  'I have little time today ' I tell her touching3 her hair  With Jasmine it is always difficult not to touch She is that rare thing a truly beautiful woman Because of this people invent reasons to walk by I catch them looking drinking her in feeding on her They are barracuda all of them Wheelchair-pushing porters who slow to a crawl when they near her bed Roaming visitors with greedy eyes Doctors who stop draw the thin screen of curtain and continually re-examine that which does not need examination  Great beauty is something Jasmine and I do not share I am glad of it  'Your father may be here soon ' I say 'Last week he said he would come ' Jasmine says nothing Her left eyelid4 flickers5 perhaps  It is two months since the incident on her father's fishing boat since she fell overboard sank became entangled6 in the nets It was some time before anyone noticed then there was panic Her father hauled her back on board and sailed for home When he finally arrived he carried ashore7 what he thought was his daughter's body  'Jasmine ' I whisper I want her to take our baited name I want her to swallow it  Fortunately there was a doctor in the village that morning a young man visiting relatives It was he who brought this drowned woman back from the brink8 he who told me her story She opened her eyes he said looked up at her father and spoke9 a single word - then sank again this time into coma10  Barracuda That is what Jasmine said  When her father visits he touches her hair kisses her cheek sits in the orange plastic chair at the side of her bed and holds her hand Like my own father he has the big brown life-roughened hands of a fisherman He too smells of the sea and pretends he is a good simple man  Jasmine We share so much we are almost one  I remember early mornings my hair touched to wake me my father lifting me half-asleep from my bed carrying me dropping me into his boat His voice rough in my ear his hands rough on my skin I never wanted to go but I was just a child He did as he wished  I remember salt water hot sun my mother shrinking on the shore I remember the rocking of the boat the screams of the gulls11  'Jasmine you have a life inside you Can't you hear it calling ' Nothing  The ward door bangs and I see Jasmine's father walking towards us carrying flowers He smiles at me  Even in death my own child had my father's smile and Jasmine's will have this man's I know it  He stops by her bed and touches her hair Something stirs deep inside me I watch Jasmine's eyelids12 waiting for her to bite
