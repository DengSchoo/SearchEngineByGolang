	A daughter complained to her father about her life and how things were so hard for her She did not know she was going to make it and want to give up She was tired of fighting and struggling It seemed as one problem was solved a new one arose 	 	Her father a cook took her to the kitchen He filled three pots with water and placed each on a high fire Soon the pots came to a boil In one he placed carrots in the second he placed eggs and in the last he placed ground coffee beans He led them sit and boil without saying a word 	 	The daughter sucked her teeth and impatiently waited wondering what he was doing In about twenty minutes he turned off the burners He fished the carrots out and placed them in a bowl He pulled the eggs out and placed them a bowl Then he ladled the coffee out and placed it in a mug Turning to her he asked " Darling what do you see "	 	"Carrots eggs and coffee " she replied 	 	He brought her closer and asked her to feel the carrots she did and noted1 that they were soft He then asked her to take an egg and break it After pulling off the shell she observed the hard-boiled egg Finally he asked her to sip2 the coffee She smiled as she tasted its rich aroma3 	 	"What does it mean Father " she humbly4 asked 	 	He explained that each of them had faced the same adversity boiling water but each reacted differently The carrot went in strong hard and unrelenting But after being subjected to the boiling water it softened5 and weak The egg had being fragile6 Its thin outer shell had protected its liquid interior7 but after sitting through the boiling water its inside became hardened The ground coffee beans were unique however After they were in the boiling water they had changed the water 	 	"Which are you " he asked his daughter 	 	When adversity knocks on your door how do you respond Are you a carrot an egg or a coffee bean a My book appeared in front of my eyes His fingers were the longest I'd seen and his nails were manicured I hadn't thought he'd bother on't have time to agonize9 
	 
	Casual dating also encourages people to form healthy friendship prior to starting relationships  My roommate and her boyfriend were friends for four months before their chemistries clicked  They went to movies and meals and often got together with mutual10 friends  They alternated paying the dinner check  "He was like a girlfriend " my roommate once laughed-blushing  Men and women relax and get to know each other more easily through such friendships  Another friends of mine believes that casual dating is improving people's social lives  When she wants to let a guy know she is interested  she'll say  "Hey  let's go get a yogurt "
	 
	Who pays for it  My past dates have taught me some things  You don't know if I'll get the wrong idea if you treat me for dinner  and I don't know if I'll deny your pleasure or offend you by insisting on paying for myself  John whipped out his wallet on our first date before I could suggest we go Dutch  During our after-dinner stroll he told me he was interested in dating me on a steady basis  After I explained I was more interested in a friendship  he told me he would have understood has I paid for my dinner  "I've practically stopped treating women on dates " he said defensively  "It's safer and more comfortable when we each pay for ourselves " John has assumed that because I graciously accepted his treat  I was in love  He was mad at himself for treating me  and I regretted allowing him to 
	 
	Larry  on the other hand  blushed when I offered to pay for my meal on our first date  I unzipped my purse and flung out my wallet  and he looked at me as if I had addressed him in a foreign language  Hesitant  I asked politely  "How much do I owe you " Larry muttered  "Uh  uh  you really don't owe me anything  but if you insist…"
	 
	Insist  I though  I only offered  To Larry  my gesture was a suggestion of rejection11 
	 
	Men and women alike are confused about who should ask whom out and who should pay  While I treasure my femininity  adore gentlemen and delight in a traditional formal date  I also believe in equality  I am grateful for casual dating because it has improved my social life immensely by making me an active participant in the process  Now I can not only receive roses but can also give them  Casual dating is a worthwhile adventure because it works  No magic formula guarantees "he" will say yes  I just have to relax  be Laura and ask him out in an unthreatening manner  If my friends are right  he'll be flattered 
	 
	Sliding into his desk  he taps my shoulder and says  "Hi  Laura  what's up "
	 
	"Good morning " I answer with nervous chills  "Hey  how would you like to have lunch after class on Friday "
	 
	"You mean after the midterm " he says encouragingly  "I'd love to go to lunch with you "
	 
	"We have a date " I smile
