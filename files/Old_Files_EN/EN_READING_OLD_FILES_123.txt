When Spring cleaning season arrived this year I decided1 that it was time to get rid of more than just a Winters worth of dust and dirt I decided that it was the time to get rid of years worth of accumulated stuff as well This stuff was lining2 my walls filling my shelves and crowding my closets This stuff was cluttering3 my home and my mind and not bringing me one bit of happiness I couldnt even remember how I got some of it but I knew I wanted it gone It turned out to be an even bigger job than I thought Twenty year old bills and receipts were tossed in the trash File cabinets were cleaned of papers that were no longer necessary or needed Broken bowls dented4 pans and cracked knickknacks were finally thrown away Unworn clothes were hauled out of the closet and bagged up to be given away to the local Goodwill5 Old books were boxed up to be passed on for others to read and enjoy It took several days to get it all done but in the end I was able to walk through a home that seemed a little less cluttered6 My heart was a lot lighter7 too It felt so good to be able to get rid of all the junk and to just focus on the essential stuff in life again What is the essential stuff What is the stuff that brings meaning to our days A loving heart is essential A joyful8 spirit is essential A soul full of goodness and God is essential And a lifefull of sharing all of these things is absolutely essential The essential stuff cant be bought sold or stored It can only be chosen created and given away The essential stuff is the stuff we all really want It is the stuff we all really need the stuff we all really need 	 a Face in the Sky> but now my mood is quite different from what it was then and I am also much older am I So I stand there looking at those clouds I want to continue looking at them  until they slowly disappear and are firmly implanted in my mind 		 	There are more and more passers-by Some of them look up into the sky like me  those are romantic types and I bless them; some of them give me a weird7 look and then hurry away  those are people whom I bless too because they have a purpose to be busy 		 	This is what life should be like: you have to do something or feel something Each of these two choices is respectable and cannot be taken lightly This is just like me at the moment: I now stand my ground Like an old antelope8 I have to be cool-headed in holding myself in my own territory next to the earthen wares9 and the wire fences 		 	Everything will be alright by six o'clock when by the park gate there will be vendors10 selling delicious and succulent minced11 pork dumplings to go with jellied tofu soup thickly dressed with fresh green parsley over brightly red chili12 oil and loosely dotted with chopped smoked turnips13 And there will also be deep-fried dough14 sticks as hot-tempered as felines15 soybean milk as demure16 as a lovely girlfriend and crispy-crusted tender-hearted green-onion-flavored pancakes as intimate as a bosom17 friend 		 	Of all the houses tightly lined up here every window has behind it a story that I have also experienced or that I am interested in hearing; everysleepwalking man cannot help fidgeting like me and every woman in pajamas18 has been loved or is now in love; every old man is rich with experiences and every child fresh; every dog is animated19 and every pigeon keen 		 	Every morning I do the same thing although I am now different from before always dreaming of unusual encounters and always wishing to inspire fervent20 passions yet always being fooled by peevish21 reality and awakened22 from fanatical visions by such unusual weather like today I am now no longer lonely Right 		 	This loneliness is like a padded cotton quilt spread out high in the sky It can be depressing descending23 entwining or uplifting depending on the change in the number of people who share my room Beautiful isn't it Yes but a little cruel I know 		 	Wow my Beijing the one that just had a traffic control yesterday the one that has had the highest temperature in the country this summer the one that has revitalized my nerves with a fresh autumn and the one that has thoroughly24 disordered my life completely unfolded my story and carefullyturned me into a new paper to write the story on
