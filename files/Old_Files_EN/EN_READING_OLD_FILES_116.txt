You can never do a kindness1 too soon for you never know how soon it will be too late How many times have we said Oh Ill do that tomorrow Sometimes tomorrow never comesand we find ourselves saying Boy I wish I hadnt put that off Our family has been friends with Betty for many years Over the yearswe shared phone callsand birthday cards Betty sent our youngest son Brandon a birthday cardwith 5 00 in ituntil he graduated This past NovemberI called Betty to see how she wasand what she had done on her birthday I was quite surprised when Betty didnt answer the phone;instead her daughter Carol2 did Carol told methat her mom had gone downhill3 fastand she was now in Hospice care Carol handed the phone to Betty I talked briefly4 to herand let her know we loved her As soon as I got off the phoneI sent a text to Brandonto let him knowBetty wasnt doing well Little did I knowthat Brandon stopped what he was doingand immediately5 sent flowers to Betty You can imaginehow proud I was of Brandonwhen Carol called the next dayletting me knowhow much Betty loved the flowersBrandon had sent A few days laterBetty died You can never do a kindness too soon for you never know how soon it will be too late  soon 	for you never know how soon it will be too late ry a negative voice in our head telling us all the things that could go wrong and why someone wouldn't want to converse5 with us 
	 
	Their research involved an experiment with a group of Chicago commuters and found that "every participant in our experiment who actually tried to talk to a stranger found the person sitting next to them was happy to chat " From this and other research  the conclusion is that connecting with strangers is surprisingly pleasant and it has a positive impact on our wellbeing  Gillian Sandstrom  a social psychologist from Essex University in the UK  told the BBC that "people are in a better mood after they reach out and have a conversation  however minimal6 " It's true that talking can make you feel happier and happiness can lead to better mental health 
	 
	However  if you're an introvert7  the thought of speaking to someone new might make you anxious  But the American research found "both extroverts8 and introverts9 are happier when they are asked to behave in an extroverted10 manner " So maybe  if you're a loner  it's time to come out of your shell and make some small talk with a stranger – it could be the beginning of a new friendship nding on reading speed  Blocking out one hour per day immediately puts you at one book per week for a typical-sized book at a typical reading speed 
	 
	Start Listening to Audiobooks
	 
	Before I started listening to audiobooks  I was reading about one book per week and 52 books per year  About two years ago  I implemented10 audiobooks – that put me at around 65 books per year  I don’t listen to audiobooks that much or that often  Usually  I listen to one  maybe two  in a month  But that makes a difference of 10 to 15 books over the course of a year  When I’m walking or driving  I can fit in extra reading time by listening to an audiobook instead of radio or music  When I’m working out in the gym or going for a run  I can squeeze in a few chapters  Or even when I’m cooking  I can throw on an audiobook 
	 
	Each of us have a lot more time in the day than we realize  but that time can often get frittered away if used without intention  Audiobooks are a means of using time more intentionally11 and in a manner conducive12 to a reading goal  They fill in the downtime with books and reading 
	 
	Most audiobooks are between 6 and 10 hours long  some of them push upwards of 12 to 15  But even for longer books  the total time is negligible when spread across weeks or months 
	 
	Consider the math once again: If you have a thirty-minute commute13 to work each way  that is potentially an hour per day to listen to a book  Or  if you only want to listen in the morning  for example  thirty minutes of extra reading per day remains14 excellent – you could get through nearly two  8-hour audiobooks per month at thirty minutes a day  I would be remiss15 to ignore the small faction16 of readers who do not count audiobooks as “reading ” So here is me addressing them  Personally  I do count audiobooks as reading – a book read aloud is still a book 
	 
	By implementing a regular time block for reading each day  reading turns into a habit and becomes automated17  Thinking about when you can “fit in” time to read no longer applies once it becomes a routine part of your day  Soon enough  it becomes an integral piece of your identity as well – you see yourself as a “reader” and so do others  which further motivates and compounds the habit of reading  Next  try out an audiobook  Give yourself a month to listen to one book  you’ll realize that you fly through the book much quicker than this  It’s a fun and leisurely18 way of reading more books  And who doesn’t like being read to by someone else 
	 
	With these two ideas  you and me and everyone else can actually read more books
