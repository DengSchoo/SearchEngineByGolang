Every Sunday morning I take a light jog around a park near my home Theres a lake located in one corner of the park Each time I jog by this lake I see the same elderly woman sitting at the waters edge with a small metal cage sitting beside her This past Sunday my curiosity got the best of me so I stopped jogging and walked over to her As I got closer I realized that the metal cage was in fact a small trap There were three turtles unharmed slowly walking around the base of the trap [lsShe had a fourth turtle in her lap that she was carefully scrubbing with a spongy brush [lsHello I said If you dont mind my nosiness1 Id love to know what youre doing with these turtles She smiled Im cleaning off their shells she replied Anything on a turtles shell like algae2 or scum reduces the turtles ability to absorb heat and impedes3 its ability to swim It can also corrode4 and weaken the shell over time She went on: I spend a couple of hours each Sunday morning relaxing by this lake and helping5 these little guys out Its my own strange way of making a difference But dont most freshwater turtles live their whole lives with algae and scum hanging from their shells I asked Yep sadly they do she replied Well then dont you think your time could be better spent And 99 of these turtles dont have kind people like you to help them clean off their shells So no offense but how exactly are your localized efforts here truly making a difference The woman giggled6 aloud She then looked down at the turtle in her lap scrubbed off the last piece of algae from its shell and said Sweetie if this little guy could talk hed tell you I just made all the difference in the world e if this little guy could talk he'd tell you I just made all the difference in the world "the melancholic6 sound of a string quartet or a singer who's got the blues7 but rather a natural chemical reaction taking place in our bodies Maybe that explanation is music to your ears if you're wondering why you've be listening to Adele on repeat cial for an economy to survive and there are laws to protect us from dishonest practices like corruption2 and fraud  But being honest with words is another matter; saying what we think to someone can get us into hot water  However a new anonymous3 messaging app has been designed that lets anyone with a link to your profile to send you a message without knowing who it's from  The app now has 300 million users which perhaps indicates how honest we really like to be – but in all honesty  do you want to know what people think about you  Is honesty always the best policy   on and so on  These feelings are universal; happiness is about being able to make space for ALL these shitty emotions  not just the positive ones  They're not a sign of brokenness or pathology  They mean you're not a robot or a psychopath
