Wherever you are and whoever you may be there is one thing in which you and I are just alike at this monment and in all the moments of our existence We are not at rest we are on a journey Our life is a movement a tendency a steady ceaseless progress towards an unseen goal  We are gaining something or losing something or losing something everyday Even when our position and our character seem to remain precisely1 the same they are changing For the mereadvance of time is a change It is not the same thing to have a bare field in January and in July The season makes the difference The limitations that are childlike in the child are childish2 in the man  Everything that we do is a step in one direction or another Even the failure to do something is in itself a deed it sets us forward or backward the action of the negative pole of a magnetic needle is just as real as the action of the positive pole To decline3 is to accept--the other alternative  Are you nearer to your port today than you were yesterday yes you must be a little nearer to some port or other for since your ship was first launched upon the sea of life you have never been still for a single moment the sea is too deep you could not find an anchorage if you would there can be no pause until you come into port mind we shared so much  from our first kiss to popcorn6 at the movie theater on our first date We laughed at inside jokes that no one else got you taught me how to dance in my backyard Of course none of those things really happened  I only imagined them Outside of my mind we never existed as a couple you never even knew my true feelings for you And I'm afraid you never will if I don't tell you now Please meet me Friday night after the prom in the park  I spent that entire evening thinking about the note and who could've written it It wasn't every day I got a note from someone who had been admiring me from afar  The next day at school I showed the note to my best friend Christy We sat down by our lockers7 musing8 over who the mysterious person could be Every time a boy walked by I contemplated9 the question: Could it be him I tried to act like it wasn't important to me After all it could just be a cruel joke someone was playing on me and I would look stupid if I made a big deal out of it  By the end of third hour everyone knew about the note I had received At noon a crowd had gathered around my locker Some wanted to see the note but I was cautious10 of who I let read it I guarded it as if it were some great treasure and to me it was  "What if its him " Diane Johansen said pointing in his direction and laughing She started doing a dead-on impersonation of Jimmy I couldn't help but laugh as Diane talked with a stutter and shook as Jimmy often did I instantly regretted it I looked at him I didn't see love or admiration11 in his eyes I saw pain  Throughout the rest of the day I kept thinking about Jimmy He had lived across the street from me for years yet I knew so little about him I remembered my mother telling me to be nice to him when I was younger She said that he needed a friend When I asked her why he acted so different she told me that his mother had done bad things when she was pregnant12 with him It wasn't until I was older that I really understood this I would occasionally wave at him on the street but not if my friends were with me I tried to make myself feel better by thinking that I had at least treated him better than others had  Jimmy was pleasantly interesting Sometimes I could see in his room through his window as I passed by He was often playing his guitar or sitting at his desk writing After I got the note I wondered if he had been writing things for me From then on I tried to see Jimmy through the window It was my only way of looking into his world I wondered if my admirer had ever done the same  One evening I got a call from Christy  "I think I know who your admirer is " she shrieked13  My heart pounded "Who " "You're not going to believe this but I think its Russell Moore At church I overheard14 him say you were cute Can you believe it " There was a long silence  "Well aren't you excited " she asked  "I guess " I said  "Who do you want it to be " she asked  I couldn't think of anyone but Jimmy so I said that I didn't know  Later that evening I considered writing Jimmy a letter I thought I could be an 'admirer' myself He thinks I hate him He thinks Im like everyone else What if I don't get the chance to tell him different But I decided15 against it I guess I wasn't as brave as my secret admirer was It was strange I wondered if I was falling in love with him All of a sudden I wanted to see him talk to him hear his voice I wondered why I felt that way  The next day was the day of the prom I woke up that morning feeling nervous I could've cared less about the dance it was where I was going afterwards that I was thinking of  The decorations at the dance were beautiful The music was great But I couldn't enjoy myself I was restless up until I left at 11:45 I began walking towards the park Although it was May it was a cool evening A breeze stirred the branches of the trees I wrapped my jacket tight around me Then I spotted16 a small park bench where I decided to wait  Thirty minutes passed and he still hadn't arrived Maybe no one was coming in the first place I thought maybe he doesn't exist I let a few tears slip out then told myself I wouldnt cry  Just then I got a call on my cell phone from Christy She sounded upset  "Marly " she shouted "Jimmy McAllister was in an accident by the school He's hurt really bad " "Oh my God " I exclaimed choking on tears "I'll be right there " I tried to run blinded by tears I tripped a few times but finally made it back to the school I saw that his truck had slid into a ditch alongside17 the school They were carrying Jimmy into the ambulance on a stretcher I don't know what made me do it but I looked inside his badly damaged truck Laying on the seat was a red rose Attached to the rose was a card that read 'for Marly 'way I suddenly felt very honored to have been chosen  "It was a privilege to be your stepmother " I whispered out loud bending to kiss his picture  Finally a sense of peace was beginning With a heavy sigh I got up to leave But as I turned to walk away the sun glistened31 on the border of the headstone causing me to look back  "Oh my gosh How could I have not noticed it before " The entire border of the headstone was trimmed in gold shafts32 of wheat    exactly like a gold shaft-of-wheat pin Conan had given me years ago Chills ran up and down my spine33 I hadn"t seen that pin in years  Somehow I just knew it was the missing link I had to find that pin  The ride home was a blur1 I was so excited Finally I was upstairs in my bedroom tearing apart my jewelry34 box Where was it Dumping the contents on the bed I frantically35 tossed earrings36 and pins to and fro  Nothing  God this is important Please help me find it I prayed  Turning from the bed I felt compelled to search my dresser Rummaging37 through drawer after drawer proved futile38 until finally in the last drawer clear in the back I felt it It was a small white box with my name scribbled39 on top in a child"s handwriting Prying40 it open I was instantly transported back in time  Conan had been about ten years old and it was the night before going on vacation to Florida He was going with us and I was packing in my room when I heard a knock on my door Conan stood there his eyes downcast and his hands behind his back  "What is it son " I asked concerned by this unexpected visit  Shuffling41 his feet he quickly mumbled42 "I don"t know why I don"t call you "Mom" very often even though I call my stepdad "Dad "" I hugged him and reassured him he was free to call me whatever he was comfortable with Then suddenly with a wry43 smile on his pudgy face he handed me the small white box  "You choose " he said and darted44 from the room  Assuming I"d find two items inside the box I opened it Instead I found the single gold wheat pin he"d bought at a garage sale with his own money  Scribbled inside the lid of the box were the words "I Love You To Mom or Connie " That had been almost a decade ago yet as I pushed the spilled contents of my jewelry box aside and slowly sat down on the edge of the bed it felt like yesterday  Thank you God for finding this pin and for the closure that comes with it  Wiping the tears from my face I reflected on an angelic little boy whose heart beat close to mine  I still choose "Mom "
