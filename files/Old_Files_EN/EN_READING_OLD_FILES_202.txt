To cultivate ones taste in English prose the most effective way is to read English books extensively Yet one may be at a loss to choose the appropriate books especially as a beginner I would like to share some of my experience My first English novel was Jane Austens Pride and Prejudice recommended by many English teachers and professors as an ideal book for English learners But my experience was somewhat disastrous1 Stumbling along the lines I had great difficulty in understanding the novel let alone enjoying it Its not the vocabulary that troubled me but rather the way Austen constructs sentences and her way of thinking which seemed too remote to me at that time My fading enthusiasm was much recovered after reading Hemingways novel Farewell to Arms No long and complicated sentences And I particularly liked his concise2 and straightforward3 style So my first suggestion is as a beginner youd better choose contemporary novels instead of classical ones You can easily engage yourself in reading get fun out of it and gradually build up confidence I do not mean to exclude classical novels for ever Actually the second reading of Pride and Prejudice greatly pleased me probably the result of my improved English comprehension It is only that classical novels are less accessible to beginners due to their language styles and social background Id like to recommend three contemporary novelists to youUrsula Le Guin Ernest Hemingway and Doris Lessing However reading novels is not the only way to improve your English In fact if you restrict yourself to novels you will miss a lot of treasures English essays can at once inform you entertain you and refine your taste in English The best example is Bertrand Russells work Its language is plain yet you cannot help feeling the elegance4 and the peculiar5 sense of humor His simple language enables his philosophy within the reach of ordinary people The same is true of George Orwells work Here comes my second suggestionessays are indispensable My last advice is never follow others recommendations and opinions blindly however famous or influential6 the person might be Some days ago I listened to the audiobook of Somerset Maughams autobiography7 The Summing Up In a chapter he regards Edward Gibbon and Samuel Johnsons style as pompous8 Though I admire Maughams prose I cannot agree with his view Probably one can label Johnsons work as pretentious9 but definitely not Gibbons In fact his lucid10 style makes his works highly readable and you can hardly believe they were written over 200 years ago Therefore we should be open to various ideas but always think and determine for ourselves As a saying goes one mans meat is another mans poison With that in mind we are bound to find out our favorite writers through reading and develop our fine taste in English nd develop our fine taste in English raduation  the coach named Daniel the team's most valuable player 
	 
	His finest hour  though  came at a school science fair  He entered an exhibit showing how the circulatory system works  It was primitive10 and crude  especially compared to the fancy  computerized  blinking-light models entered by other students  My wife  Sara  felt embarrassed for him 
	 
	It turned out that the other kids had not done their own work-their parents had made their exhibits  As the judges went on their rounds  they found that these other kids couldn't answer their questions  Daniel answered every one  When the judges awarded the Albert Einstein Plaque11 for the best exhibit  they gave it to him 
	 
	By the time Daniel left for college he stood six feet tall and weighed 170 pounds  He was muscular and in superb condition  but he never pitched another inning  having given up baseball for English literature  I was sorry that he would not develop his athletic12 talent  but proud that he had made such a mature decision 
	 
	One day I told Daniel that the great failing in my life had been that I didn't take a year or two off to travel when I finished college  This is the best way  to my way of thinking  to broaden oneself and develop a larger perspective on life  Once I had married and begun working  I found that the dream of living in another culture had vanished 
	 
	Daniel thought about this  His friends said that he would be insane to put his career on hold  But he decided13 it wasn't so crazy  After graduation  he worked as a waiter at college  a bike messenger and a house painter  With the money he earned  he had enough to go to Paris 
	 
	The night before he was to leave  I tossed in bed  I was trying to figure out something to say  Nothing came to mind  Maybe  I thought  it wasn't necessary to say anything #p#    #e#
	 
	What does it matter in the course of a life-time if a father never tells a son what he really thinks of him  But as I stood before Daniel  I knew that it does matter  My father and I loved each other  Yet  I always regretted never hearing him put his feelings into words and never having the memory of that moment  Now  I could feel my palms sweat and my throat tighten14  Why is it so hard to tell a son something from the heart  My mouth turned dry  and I knew I would be able to get out only a few words clearly 
	 
	"Daniel " I said  "if I could have picked  I would have picked you "
	 
	That's all I could say  I wasn't sure he understood what I meant  Then he came toward me and threw his arms around me  For a moment  the world and all its people vanished  and there was just Daniel and me in our home by the sea 
	 
	He was saying something  but my eyes misted over  and I couldn't understand what he was saying  All I was aware of was the stubble on his chin as his face pressed against mine  And then  the moment ended  I went to work  and Daniel left a few hours later with his girlfriend 
	 
	That was seven weeks ago  and I think about him when I walk along the beach on weekends  Thousands of miles away  somewhere out past the ocean waves breaking on the deserted15 shore  he might be scurrying16 across Boulevard Saint Germain  strolling through a musty hallway of the Louvre  bending an elbow in a Left Bank café 
	 
	What I had said to Daniel was clumsy and trite17  It was nothing  And yet  it was everything
