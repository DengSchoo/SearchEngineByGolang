What would life be like without music Songs and tunes1 fill our lives affecting our emotions bringing back memories and sometimes making us dance There is a song for everyone and for every occasion but it seems that its sad music that moves us most Sad music certainly does its job in making us depressed2 emotional and causing us to sob3 its something we might listen to after a breakup for example And a recent study has shown why some people are hooked on sad music Professor David Huron from Ohio State University conducted the research and looked at the difference between people who love to listen to sad music and those who cant stand it He told the BBC radio programme The Why Factor that it comes down to a natural hormone4 called prolactin He says: as you might have guessed from the name its associated with lactation from breastfeeding When people cry they also release prolactin And there are circumstances in which prolactin seems to have this comforting effect It seems that people who like sad music are maybe getting too much prolactin or more than is normal and when they hear sad downbeat music it gives them a good feeling But if prolactin isnt released or there isnt enough of it some people find that sad sounds dont help to cheer them up Previous research by Durham University has also suggested that listening to sad music can trigger pain and sadness; but it can also provide comfort and even enjoyment5 A high number of people they surveyed were cheered up by listening to supposedly sad songs Though the feeling may not be exactly the same as happiness it may be the ability to cope with the sadness that gives the feeling of comfort So reacting to sad music on the radio may have nothing to do with the melancholic6 sound of a string quartet or a singer whos got the blues7 but rather a natural chemical reaction taking place in our bodies Maybe that explanation is music to your ears if youre wondering why youve be listening to Adele on repeat  be listening to Adele on repeat   	However if you're an introvert7 the thought of speaking to someone new might make you anxious But the American research found "both extroverts8 and introverts9 are happier when they are asked to behave in an extroverted10 manner " So maybe if you're a loner it's time to come out of your shell and make some small talk with a stranger  it could be the beginning of a new friendship itional4 love

	All of this time  though  Kai was slowly dying from a terrible combination of Cancer and C O P D 
	 
	She had told me the first time we talked that she was terminal  
	 
	Yet  she lived each day with such vitality5 that I often forgot just how ill she was 
	  ，          ，        ，       。
	 
	In time her health did wane6 and she spent more and more time resting and sleeping 
	 
	I still visited her but only on her few "good" days 
	        ，             “   ” 。
	 
	She died on a cold  Winter's day with heavy snow falling down like teardrops from sky 
	          ，             ，      。
	 
	In spite of the short time we had together
	 
	I learned so much from Kai
	 
	about how to truly live all the days we are given here 
	 
	Lessons on kindness  generosity7   hope  and good cheer seemed to flow freely from her daily life 
	 
	I think most of all she taught me that joy like love is quite contagious8
	 
	and that I should always strive to be a carrier of them both 
	 
	May the same be said for all of us 
	 
	Thanks Kai
