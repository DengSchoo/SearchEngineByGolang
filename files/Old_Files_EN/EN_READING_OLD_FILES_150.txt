Someone once told me that never underestimate anyone who doesnt lose temper This kind of people usually possess great capacity They can be really resourceful friends And they can be really fierce enemies Humans are emotional animals Its our nature to have temper And its totally natural to lose it when something or somebody irritates us But there are people who dont And thats a fearsome skill The more incompetent1 a person is the easier he is to get angry The stronger a person is the less you see him throw away his calmness Can you hold your temper If you want to achieve great things Practice to do so reat things Practice to do so 	the flowers or talking to the worms When it realized how different the world seemed when it rolled so quickly it stopped left its found piece by the side of the road and rolled slowly away 	 	The lesson of the story I suggested was that in some strange sense we are more whole when we are missingsomething The man who has everything is in some ways a poor man He will never know what it feels like to yearn2 to hope to nourish his soul with the dream of something better He will never know the experience ofhaving someone who loves him give him something he has always wanted or never had 	 	There is a wholeness about the person who has come to terms with his limitations who has been brave enough to let go of his unrealistic dreams and not feel like a failure for doing so There is a wholeness about the man or woman who has learned that he or she is strong enough to go through a tragedy and survive who can lose someone and still feel like a complete person 	 	Life is not a trap set for us by God so that he can condemn3 us for failing Life is not a spelling bee where no matter how many words you've gotten right you're disqualified if you make one mistake Life ismore like a baseball season where even the best team loses onethird of its games and even the worst team has its days of brilliance4 Our goal is to win more games than we lose 	 	When we accept that imperfection is part of being human and when we can continue rolling through life andappreciate it we will have achieved a wholeness that others can only aspire5 to That I believe is what God asks of us not "Be perfect" not "Don't even make a mistake" but "Be whole "	 	If we are brave enough to love strong enough to forgive generous enough to rejoice in another's happiness and wise enough to know there is enough love to go around for us all then we can achieve a fulfillmentthat no other living creature will ever know

	Number two  listen to your thoughts 
	  ，       。
	 
	Even when you're avoiding your responsibilities  your mind is actively9 thinking about them  You may discover you have a hard time enjoying whatever you're distracting yourself with  Your mind is too focused on your laziness to prioritize anything else  You end up feeling irritated and guilty because as much as you want to forget  well you can't  People are laziest when they're in denial  Imagine you have a paper due next week  In the back of your mind you know it's gonna be a ton of work  You still have to gather sources  find quotes  write your thesis  you know  the list goes on and on  Yet here you are spending hours on social media  You convince yourself you still have plenty of time  but your gut10 is telling you otherwise  Whenever you continue thinking about one thing  it means it's time to get started  Not tomorrow  not in a few hours  right now  Because this thought isn't just popping up out of nowhere  It's the productive part of your brain telling you the right thing to do  So don't try to block it out with TV or video games  You can use the same trick when you have a completely packed to-do list  If you're struggling to figure out what to do first  tackle the task that you can't stop thinking about  The longer you try to ignore it  the more frustrated11 you're gonna feel  You'll never feel satisfied until you get that big-ticket item out of your head

	Number three  the power of reliability12 
	  ，       。
	 
	Even if you're great about setting new goals  you may have a hard time following through  You might make a to-do list and lay out specific concrete steps but what stops you from bailing14 at the last minute  Let's say you want to start working out  You research exercises  you buy gym clothes and you even get a gym membership  Yet you never actually show up  You end up watching TV or playing video games because  well  you can  If you decide to skip the gym for the tenth time  you're not affecting anyone but yourself  There's no one there to hold you accountable  You should use reliability to motivate yourself to do things that you normally wouldn't  So the next time you plan on going to the gym  ask one of your friends to meet you there  That way someone else will be counting on you to show up  They'll expect you to follow through  so if you don't you won't get off scot-free like you did before  Reliability is effective for a number of reasons  but trust is a big one  You show up because you don't want to blow off your friend  You invited them to the gym so you can't just bail13 because you're feeling lazy  Sitting around watching Netflix is a pretty terrible reason to damage a friendship  Reliability also motivates you because you want your friend to think highly of you  You want them to see you as someone who takes their goals seriously  So when you're on your own it's easier to fail because no one has to know about it  Your friends and family won't have a different opinion of you if you don't go  But now your friend will see firsthand whether you're following through or not  So you show up to make sure you leave a good impression  For the same reason you're more likely to actually try while you're there  You can't just leave after five minutes or sit on your phone the whole time  Sitting there watching your friend do what they're supposed to do will motivate you to follow suit  Finally  reliability can make things more fun  It gives you someone to talk to which relieves anxiety and stress  Your friend might also be more experienced so they can help you get the most out of whatever you're doing  If you're struggling to find motivation on your own  hey  there's no shame in calling for backup  The simple fact that someone else is involved will jumpstart your work ethic15

	Number four  undermine your fears 
	  ，    。
	 
	Sometimes our laziness isn't really laziness  You might procrastinate16 or avoid doing something because well you're worried about what will happen when you try  You might have set your expectations way too high  You might feel an overwhelming amount of pressure to succeed  This can make even the smallest chores feel like huge responsibilities  You end up running away because you can't fail at something that you never actually do  Now to avoid this kind of laziness  check your expectations at the door  In other words  when you start a project  you only have one job and that's to start  Don't be afraid of making something terrible  just begin working on the first thing that pops into your mind  This gets you past that initial roadblock  Every project is way less intimidating17 when you're already halfway18 done  This is the same reason that teachers encourage their students to write rough drafts  You make something rough and imperfect to get an idea of where you're headed  Yeah it won't be very good because it's not supposed to be  There aren't any expectations or pressure  but you'll find that things seem a lot more doable afterwards  So when you're feeling lazy  don't be afraid to get a little messy  Improving something bad's a whole lot easier than making something perfect from scratch

	Number five  dress for productivity 
	  ，        。
	 
	Where are you the laziest  Well if you're like most people you probably feel lethargic19 whenever you're trying to work or study in your room  And your clothes maybe the biggest reason why  Now everyone knows it's a whole lot more comfortable to work in sweatpants or pajamas20  If you're gonna spend all day doing something that you don't want to  you might as well be comfy  right  The truth is your clothes can directly affect your habits  This is one of the biggest reasons why so many companies make their employees dress up for work  even if they aren't interacting with customers  Your brain naturally associates your habits with your environment  Think about studying in your room versus21 studying in the library  the latter is way more efficient  because your brain doesn't see your room as a workspace  So when you're in your room  your brain unconsciously thinks about relaxation22 and sleep  because that's what it's used to doing  But the library puts you in a different mental space  this new environment primes your brain to work and think harder than it would anywhere else  Clothes work the exact same way  What are you usually doing when you wear sweatpants  Chances are you aren't taking tests or going to meetings  you're probably playing video games or watching TV  So that's what your brain thinks about when you're wearing them  The lazier your clothes are  the lazier you'll feel  To overcome this kind of laziness  change into clothes that help you focus  Don't worry  you don't have to wear a suit and tie  You should choose something you wouldn't mind wearing out into the world  This is an especially helpful tip for students and people who work from home  Yeah it's tempting23 to lounge around all day in your comfiest outfit24  but you need to tell your brain when it's time to shift gears  A change of clothing is an easy and effective way to do just that
