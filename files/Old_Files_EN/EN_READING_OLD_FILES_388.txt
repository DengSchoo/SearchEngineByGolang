Up earlier than usual The air is calling  Spring air is different from winter air  Tree branches are serrated with red bud teeth  Later they grow chartreuse fuzz making pale green auras in the sun  Summer leaves will be dark shading but spring leaves let the light through  Spring trees glow in the daytime spreading translucent1 canopies2  The birds are out racketing their news from bush to branch Cats are still curled up on fire escapes They are in no hurry to get up in the cool morning air and they know it will warm up later They are watching the birds They can wait  The air is clear clean cool The smells are tiny smells little whiffs of green a ribbon of brown mud the blue smell of the sky Midday is mild enough for short sleeves I eat my lunch outsider sitting on a warm brick wall The breeze lifts my hair and riffles the edge of my skirt I have to squint3 Everything tastes better  Until today I had been too huddled4 in my winter coat to notice the quiet coming of flowers Suddenly daffodils smile in my face parrot tulips wave their beaky petals5 and fragrant6 white blossoms are pinned to dogwood trees like bows in a young girl's hair  The evening is soft I need my thin jacket  It's still light out when I walk home from the Metro7  I could walk for hours  Like a kid playing street games with her friends I don't want to go in  When I went to work this morning I left my windows open  Spring came in through the screens while I was gone  It's as if I had used a big sliver8 key and rolled back the roof like a lid on a sardine9 can  The indoors smell like the outdoors  It will be like lying down in the grass to sleep  The sheets are cool The quilt is warm  The light fades outside my windows This weekend I think I'll wash my car he harvest will be vice Good companionships help us to sow virtue; evil companionships help us to sow vice how to do yourself a favor  you won't be confident and ready enough to resist the attack of illness  To get a thorough understanding of oneself is to get a full control of one's life  Then one will find one's life full of color and flavor
