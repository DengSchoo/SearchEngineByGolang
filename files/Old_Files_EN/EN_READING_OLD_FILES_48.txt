Authors dont write books they write manuscripts Publishing is the process of getting an authors manuscript into the hands of a reader by materializing it giving it form as a book This may be printed a codex or digital an ebook The authors manuscript is either solicited1 the publisher asks them to write it or unsolicited the author writes it then shops for a publisher Being rejected is awful and publishing contracts are complicated so many authors employ an agent to negotiate a deal with a publisher The publisher refers to either the publishing house such as Penguin2 Random3 House or the person whose title is Publisher Within a single publishing house there may be several publishers each overseeing a different list based on genre4 For example there may be a literary publisher an academic publisher and a nonfiction publisher within the same publishing house PublisherWithin the publishing house different departments deal with different aspects of the publishing process Editorial is concerned with content: ensuring the storyinformation is communicated in a clear and engaging way Sales Marketing6 and Publicity7 are concerned with context: figuring out where the book sits in the market how to get it into bookstores and reviewed The designer is generally commissioned by the publisher or editor overseeing the title Some publishers have creative directors who commission freelance or assign inhouse designers The designer is given a brief a document that outlines the format5 size and shape production schedule information about the content and context of the book including a blurb8 a version of what end ups on the back cover and passages that represent the writing style and plot Some designers also read the full manuscript Unless its a math textbook Designers usually communicate directly with the publishereditor but need to respond to critical feedback from SalesMarketing to develop a cover that communicates both the content of the book evoking a sense of what its about and the writing style and the context ensuring it looks like it belongs to its genre and is appealing to the intended audience This balance happens by showing roughs for different approaches Designers usually present two to three different concepts roughly mocked up to show how the final cover might look 23A process of toandfro between editor publisher sales and marketing continues until everyone is happy 50A quick design process might involve seven or eight different iterations before a final design is chosen followed by a process of finetuning make the title bigger try a script font Marketing wants the author in gold foil etc A painful design process can involve dozens of covers; There is a record of 50 different approaches for the one cover Excruciating 7850People are often surprised how little input9 authors have in the design process considering the cover is how their book first faces the world Its important to consider two factors First most authors are happy to defer10 to the publisher about how to sell as many copies of their book as possible; publishing is a commercial business and the publisher knows the market Second while the design process is happening the author is generally in the last harrowing stage of editing their manuscript and doesnt want any distraction11 This said if an author hates a cover it will go back to the drawing board but if everyone has done their job well this shouldnt happen Once the design is finalized12 digital files are sent to a production house so copies of the book can be printed bound and delivered to the publishers warehouse13 from where they will be shipped to bookstores when wanted ies of the book can be printed bound and delivered to the publisher's warehouse13 from where they will be shipped to bookstores when wanted
