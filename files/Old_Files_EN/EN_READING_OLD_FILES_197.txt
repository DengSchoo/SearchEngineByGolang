view Probably one can label Johnson's work as pretentious9 but definitely not Gibbon's In fact his lucid10 style makes his works highly readable and you can hardly believe they were written over 200 years ago Therefore we should be open to various ideas but always think and determine for ourselves As a saying goes one man's meat is another man's poison With that in mind we are bound to find out

responsibilities  your mind is actively9 thinking about them  You may discover you have a hard time enjoying whatever you're distracting yourself with  Your mind is too focused on your laziness to prioritize anything else  You end up feeling irritated and guilty because as much as you want to forget  well you can't  People are laziest when they're in denial  Imagine you have a paper due next week  In the back of your mind you know it's gonna be a ton of work  You still have to gather sources  find quotes  write your thesis  you know  the list goes on and on  Yet here you are spending hours on social media  You convince yourself you still have plenty of time  but your gut10 is telling you otherwise  Whenever you continue thinking about one thing  it means it's time to get started  Not tomorrow  not in a few hours  right now  Because this thought isn't just popping up out of nowhere  It's the productive part of your brain telling you the right thing to do  So don't try to block it out with TV or video games  You can use the same trick when you have a completely packed to-do list  If you're struggling to figure out what to do first  tackle the task that you can't stop thinking about  The longer you try to ignore it  the more frustrated11 you're gonna feel  You'll never feel satisfied until you get that big-ticket item out of your head

                	 	Number three  the power of reliability12 	           	 	Even if you're great about setting new goals  you may have a hard time following through  You might make a to-do list and lay out specific concrete steps but what stops you from bailing14 at the last minute  Let's say you want to start working out  You research exercises  you buy gym clothes and you even get a gym membership  Yet you never actually show up  You end up watching TV or playing video games because  well  you can  If you decide to skip the gym for the tenth time  you're not affecting anyone but yourself  There's no one there to hold you accountable  You should use reliability to motivate yourself to do things that you normally wouldn't  So the next time you plan on going to the gym  ask one of your friends to meet you there  That way someone else will be counting on you to show up  They'll expect you to follow through  so if you don't you won't get off scot-free like you did before  Reliability is effective for a number of reasons  but trust is a big one  You show up because you don't want to blow off your friend  You invited them to the gym so you can't just bail13 because you're feeling lazy  Sitting around watching Netflix is a pretty terrible reason to damage a friendship  Reliability also motivates you because you want your friend to think highly of you  You want them to see you as someone who takes their goals seriously  So when you're on your own it's easier to fail because no one has to know about it  Your friends and family won't have a different opinion of you if you don't go  But now your friend will see firsthand whether you're following through or not  So you show up to make sure you leave a good impression  For the same reason you're more likely to actually try while you're there  You can't just leave after five minutes or sit on your phone the whole time  Sitting there watching your friend do what they're supposed to do will motivate you to follow suit  Finally  reliability can make things more fun  It gives you someone to talk to which relieves anxiety and stress  Your friend might also be more experienced so they can help you get the most out of whatever you're doing  If you're struggling to find motivation on your own  hey  there's no shame in calling for backup  The simple fact that someone else is involved will jumpstart your work ethic15

	 	Sometimes our laziness isn't really laziness  You might procrastinate16 or avoid doing something because well you're worried about what will happen when you try  You might have set your expectations way too high  You might feel an overwhelming amount of pressure to succeed  This can make even the smallest chores feel like huge responsibilities  You end up running away because you can't fail at something that you never actually do  Now to avoid this kind of laziness  check your expectations at the door  In other words  when you start a project  you only have one job and that's to start  Don't be afraid of making something terrible  just begin working on the first thing that pops into your mind  This gets you past that initial roadblock  Every project is way less intimidating17 when you're already halfway18 done  This is the same reason that teachers encourage their students to write rough drafts  You make something rough and imperfect to get an idea of where you're headed  Yeah it won't be very good because it's not supposed to be  There aren't any expectations or pressure  but you'll find that things seem a lot more doable afterwards  So when you're feeling lazy  don't be afraid to get a little messy  Improving something bad's a whole lot easier than making something perfect from scratch

are you the laziest  Well if you're like most people you probably feel lethargic19 whenever you're trying to work or study in your room  And your clothes maybe the biggest reason why  Now everyone knows it's a whole lot more comfortable to work in sweatpants or pajamas20  If you're gonna spend all day doing something that you don't want to  you might as well be comfy  right  The truth is your clothes can directly affect your habits  This is one of the biggest reasons why so many companies make their employees dress up for work  even if they aren't interacting with customers  Your brain naturally associates your habits with your environment  Think about studying in your room versus21 studying in the library  the latter is way more efficient  because your brain doesn't see your room as a workspace  So when you're in your room  your brain unconsciously thinks about relaxation22 and sleep  because that's what it's used to doing  But the library puts you in a different mental space  this new environment primes your brain to work and think harder than it would anywhere else  Clothes work the exact same way  What are you usually doing when you wear sweatpants  Chances are you aren't taking tests or going to meetings  you're probably playing video games or watching TV  So that's what your brain thinks about when you're wearing them  The lazier your clothes are  the lazier you'll feel  To overcome this kind of laziness  change into clothes that help you focus  Don't worry  you don't have to wear a suit and tie  You should choose something you wouldn't mind wearing out into the world  This is an especially helpful tip for students and people who work from home  Yeah it's tempting23 to lounge around all day in your comfiest outfit24  but you need to tell your brain when it's time to shift gears  A change of clothing is an easy and effective way to do just that
