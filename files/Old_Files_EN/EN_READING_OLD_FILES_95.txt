When I was in high school our physics teacher gave us a challenge that involved making a paper air plane of any shape The only objective1 was to get it to fly as far as possible I had some paper air plane making skills so I made the best plane I could and it flew pretty far One guy made the greatest yet simplest paper airplane of all time He stood there at the starting line with a regular piece of paper Some classmates scratched their head while silently chuckling2 to themselves Moments later he took the flat piece of paper crumpled3 it up and threw it down the hall way He beat the class with ease4 Some of the students got mad and said that he cheated The physics teacher said How so I said it could be any shape A paper ball is indeed a shape I still regard this classmate as a genius egard this classmate as a genius 	ck right where they were 	 	Like the elephants how many of us go through life hanging onto a belief that we cannot do something simply because we failed at it once before 	 	Failure is part of learning4; we should never give up the struggle in life too  It felt so good to be able to get rid of all the junk and to just focus on the essential stuff in life again 	 	What is the essential stuff  What is the stuff that brings meaning to our days  A loving heart is essential  A joyful8 spirit is essential  A soul full of goodness and God is essential 	 	And a lifefull of sharing all of these things is absolutely essential  The essential stuff can't be bought  sold  or stored  It can only be chosen  created  and given away  The essential stuff is the stuff we all really want  It is the stuff we all really need 	 ologist Shira Gabriel told the BBC: "We feel guilty because we don't realise that what's happening is our minds [are] finding a way to trigger a really positive emotion and they're making us eat that food to do so "	 	Maybe we should take comfort from the fact that eating certain food just makes us feel happy  But  for some people  eating any kind of food brings joy  warmth  happiness and comfort l find that the more love you give away  the more love you will have  You will find that the more love you share  the more God’s love will surround you  You will find that when you live your life in love  you will find love everywhere
