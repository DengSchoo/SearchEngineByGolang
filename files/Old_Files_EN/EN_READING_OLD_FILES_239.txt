Several years ago while attending a communications course I experienced a most unusual process The instructor1 asked us to list anything in our past that we felt ashamed of guilty about regretted or incomplete about The next week he invited participants to read their lists aloud This seemed like a very private process but theres always some brave soul in the crowd who will volunteer As people read their lists mine grew longer After three weeks I had 101 items on my list The instructor then suggested that we find ways to make amends2 apologize to people or take some action to right any wrongdoing I was seriously wondering how this could ever improve my communications having visions of alienating3 just about everyone from my life The next week the man next to me raised his hand and volunteered this story:While making my list I remembered an incident from high school I grew up in a small town in Iowa There was a sheriff in town that none of us kids liked One night my two buddies4 and I decided5 to play a trick on Sheriff Brown After drinking a few beers we found a can of red paint climbed the tall water tank in the middle of town and wrote on the tank in bright red letters: Sheriff Brown is an s o b The next day the town arose to see our glorious sign Within two hours Sheriff Brown had my two pals6 and me in his office My friends confessed and I lied denying the truth No one ever found out Nearly 20 years later Sheriff Browns name appears on my list I didnt even know if he was still alive Last weekend I dialed information in my hometown back in Iowa Sure enough there was a Roger Brown still listed I dialed his number After a few rings I heard: Hello I said: Sheriff Brown Pause Yup Well this is Jimmy Calkins And I want you to know that I did it Pause I knew it he yelled back We had a good laugh and a lively discussion His closing words were: Jimmy I always felt badly for you because your buddies got it off their chest and I knew you were carrying it around all these years I want to thank you for calling me for your sake Jimmy inspired me to clear up all 101 items on my list It took me almost two years but became the springboard and true inspiration for my career as a conflict mediator7 No matter how difficult the conflict crisis or situation I always remember that its never too late to clear up the past and begin resolution o clear up the past and begin resolution  930s  Set in rural Georgia  Celie  the novel's protagonist18  suffers immense abuse and victimisation as a black girl growing up in a racially segregated19 community  Later  her meeting with Shug Avery  a glitzy singer and magic-maker  helps Celie push back against the repressive society around her and take charge of her own destiny  PHILIP K  DICK  THE MAN IN THE HIGH CASTLE A novel of diffuse20 influences and phenomenal imaginative power  Philip K  Dick's The Man in the High Castle challenged the foundations of American exceptionalism  Dick postulates21 an alternate ending to the Second World War  one which witnessed the defeat of the Allies  the conquest of the American continent by the Japanese Empire and Nazi22 Germany  and the subsequent Cold War 'fought' between the two new Axis23 Powers  Suffused24 with East Asian philosophy  and featuring passages written in stunning25 Japanese-English creole  the book explores the veracity26 of the reality we live in  how we negotiate 'true' or 'fake' identities in the face of persecution27  and how much true 'value' can be derived28 from any sense of national pride ondered how someone who had so little could be so giving to a stranger  Then she remembered Bryan  After the lady finished her meal  and the waitress went to get change for her hundred dollar bill  the lady slipped right out the door  She was gone by the time the waitress came back  She wondered where the lady could be  then she noticed something written on the napkin under which were 4 more $100 bills  There were tears in her eyes when she read what the lady wrote  It said:
	 
	"You don't owe me anything  I have been there too  Somebody once helped me out  the way I'm helping you  If you really want to pay me back  here is what you do: Do not let this chain of love end with you" 
	 
	Well  there were tables to clear  sugar bowls to fill  and people to serve  but the waitress made it through another day  That night when she got home from work and climbed into bed  she was thinking about the money and what the lady had written  How could the lady have known how much she and her husband needed it  With the baby due next month  it was going to be hard  She knew how worried her husband was  and as he lay sleeping next to her  she gave him a soft kiss and whispered soft and low  "Everything's gonna be all right; I love you  Bryan "
