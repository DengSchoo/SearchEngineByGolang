	I Have Run Head-on into Autumn		 	Because early morning is the most pleasant time of the day in this long hot summer I have developed a habit of getting up or going to bed at daybreak which is around four thirty for sure 		 	That is the pattern of my life 		 	But last night I went to bed earlier at about eleven o'clock When I wake up it is still dark outside I am about to go back to sleep when I suddenly become aware of the unusualness in the buzz of mosquitoes and the flow of the air They don't seem to be happening during the thick darkness of midnight Looking at my watch I find it already five o'clock as I have expected 		 	After rolling out of bed and rushing through my morning routine I walk out of my room which is as hot and smoky as a kitchen No sooner have I stepped out of the halfway1 than I run head-on into autumn almost to be knocked back 		 	First comes the wind slowly like a huge fluttering skirt caressing2 me from head to toe Like toothpaste being squeezed I feel an immediate3 thorough relief in my heart 		 	I am not as energetic in the summer as I am in the winter mainly due to the lucidness of my mind Now an earlier autumn has come to resolve my problem Why not go with it 		 	The sky that has borne me down throughout the whole summer has suddenly lifted Looking up I see numerous small-sized clouds as white assterling silver neatly4 lined up in the limpidly5 blue sky The more I gaze at them the more they look naughty and resemble my innate6 inspirations How I wish I could bring them down and take a few bites at them 		 	I now remember a song I wrote quite a while ago <I See a Face in the Sky> but now my mood is quite different from what it was then and I am also much older am I So I stand there looking at those clouds I want to continue looking at them  until they slowly disappear and are firmly implanted in my mind 		 	There are more and more passers-by Some of them look up into the sky like me  those are romantic types and I bless them; some of them give me a weird7 look and then hurry away  those are people whom I bless too because they have a purpose to be busy 		 	This is what life should be like: you have to do something or feel something Each of these two choices is respectable and cannot be taken lightly This is just like me at the moment: I now stand my ground Like an old antelope8 I have to be cool-headed in holding myself in my own territory next to the earthen wares9 and the wire fences 		 	Everything will be alright by six o'clock when by the park gate there will be vendors10 selling delicious and succulent minced11 pork dumplings to go with jellied tofu soup thickly dressed with fresh green parsley over brightly red chili12 oil and loosely dotted with chopped smoked turnips13 And there will also be deep-fried dough14 sticks as hot-tempered as felines15 soybean milk as demure16 as a lovely girlfriend and crispy-crusted tender-hearted green-onion-flavored pancakes as intimate as a bosom17 friend 		 	Of all the houses tightly lined up here every window has behind it a story that I have also experienced or that I am interested in hearing; everysleepwalking man cannot help fidgeting like me and every woman in pajamas18 has been loved or is now in love; every old man is rich with experiences and every child fresh; every dog is animated19 and every pigeon keen 		 	Every morning I do the same thing although I am now different from before always dreaming of unusual encounters and always wishing to inspire fervent20 passions yet always being fooled by peevish21 reality and awakened22 from fanatical visions by such unusual weather like today I am now no longer lonely Right 		 	This loneliness is like a padded cotton quilt spread out high in the sky It can be depressing descending23 entwining or uplifting depending on the change in the number of people who share my room Beautiful isn't it Yes but a little cruel I know 		 	Wow my Beijing the one that just had a traffic control yesterday the one that has had the highest temperature in the country this summer the one that has revitalized my nerves with a fresh autumn and the one that has thoroughly24 disordered my life completely unfolded my story and carefullyturned me into a new paper to write the story on 	balls   but I just knew l would get nowhere staying in my hometown  He threatened to give me no financial help at all  and I said that was fine  I would be able to get enough loans

	Eventually I signed my family up for a tour of the state university  My dad and I toured campus  and even though it was very cold  my dad fell in love - or at the very least seemed very enthusiastic about every corner of the campus

	I could tell he was softened8 by this visit  but the fights about where I was going to get the money continued until the day I packed everything up into our minivan   It was then  at breakfast before we made our journey down  that my dad said he was proud of me  He hadn't thought I would actually leave  and he was impressed  As my parents dropped me off at my dorm room  my mom started crying hysterically9   and even my dad teared up  kissing me on the forehead  which was the first time I could remember getting hugged and kissed by them in years

	At this point  my relationship with my parents changed  No longer were they the disciplinarians but they became confidants   advisors10 and an excellent support system  and I became an adult  Sometimes I still expect to get yelled at for my decisions  but they've done phenomenally well to leave me to my own life  and to just be happy when I actually call home  No matter what happens now  I know standing11 my ground on where to go for school has been the best decision of my life  as I have gained both a good education and a precious life experience I never would have been exposed to had I taken any other road
