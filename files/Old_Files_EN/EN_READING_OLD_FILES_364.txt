The greatest high in life is when you fall in love Love well you cannot snatch it lock it or create it It should come from within you Being in love is an experience and only if you go through it you will know the intricacies of it You feel your best when you are in love Love is a process where your brain has taken a backseat and your heart is working overtime1  Love is not just a four-letter word but it's a totally different feeling which takes your entire body soul and mind to altogether a different world Love can neither be created nor destroyed It passes from one person to another The total amount of love in the universe always increases and never remains2 constant  I like any normal human being have had a lot of crushes from my childhood How often do we use the word crush All the feelings and thoughts are dumped into it if we make no further progress with our infatuation This happens not only for the fear of rejection3 but also because many of us fail to approach If this ego4 had disappeared probably a quarter of us would have been in a love relationship with our crush t the better of us Expectation is the silent killer3 which murders millions of mushy and time tested relationships If there would have been no expectations from anyone the world would have been a much better place to be If there would have been no expectationds not many people would have had an aching heart and a life long grouse4 against there would have been better haves If it wouldn't have been for unreasonable5 expectations not many couples would have divorced each other  How to come out of expectations them Good question The answer is when you give something don't expect anything in return When our mother gave birth to us she never expected that we will give birth to her She has just fulfilled her desire to raise a family and live for them In the same way let our actions make us live for our self and let not expectation screw up the major portion of your lives Let us have the freedom and will power to express our love affection and longingness for people whenever we feel Let us not restrict our freedom of expression just because he or she is not responding the way we want them to  Well all in all a little bit of loneliness is good for a self-analysis to keep a check over your actions Introspection always makes you communicate with the innerself but too much of introspection can make you scale the altitude of self pity So show restrain at the right time
