Theres a concept in psychology1 called the comfort zone which is a place or situation where you feel safe comfortable and without stress It sounds nice and peaceful doesnt it Who wouldnt like to live in such a place all the time Unfortunately if you never venture outside of your comfort zone youll never grow A kid who never tries cycling downhill because hes afraid of scraping his knee will never feel confident while riding a bike A shy woman who always avoids social settings because she fears embarrassment2 will always feels selfconscious around others A gymgoer who never tries lifting heavier weights because hes afraid he wont be able to lift them will never grow his muscles Heck If it wasnt for the first curious prehistoric3 humans we would still live in caves And you most certainly wouldnt be watching this video now Leaving your comfort zone as uncomfortable and stressful as that can be sometimes is a must if you want to grow as a person Make it a habit to try new things as often as you can Skydiving talking to that random4 stranger learning a foreign language picking a strange new book taking Argentinian tango classes rock climbing learning how to sew What new things will you try today  at new things will you try today 	   ore books This creates a non-negotiable block of time which you can use to incrementally6 hack away at your reading goals for the week month and year; it provides the opportunity to read productively Without scheduling regular reading time in achieving reading goals is more difficult Building this time block for reading will make reading a habit such that it no longer becomes something you need to think about plan or worry over The time block becomes a habit and the habit is what automates7 reading into your life as an inextricable piece to who you are and what you do 	 	Reading at the same time each and every day further ensures that you have no excuses to intrude8 upon your reading goals Make that time sacred and untouchable  schedule meetings and social outings before or after that time block but give priority to your allotted9 reading time 	 	For myself I read first thing for one hour in the morning every single morning  no intrusions no interruptions no exceptions This allows me to read around one book per week 	 	Consider the math: a book of around 200-300 pages takes about 5-7 hours to read on average depending on reading speed Blocking out one hour per day immediately puts you at one book per week for a typical-sized book at a typical reading speed 	 	Start Listening to Audiobooks	 	Before I started listening to audiobooks I was reading about one book per week and 52 books per year About two years ago I implemented10 audiobooks  that put me at around 65 books per year I dont listen to audiobooks that much or that often Usually I listen to one maybe two in a month But that makes a difference of 10 to 15 books over the course of a year When Im walking or driving I can fit in extra reading time by listening to an audiobook instead of radio or music When Im working out in the gym or going for a run I can squeeze in a few chapters Or even when Im cooking I can throw on an audiobook 	 	Each of us have a lot more time in the day than we realize but that time can often get frittered away if used without intention Audiobooks are a means of using time more intentionally11 and in a manner conducive12 to a reading goal They fill in the downtime with books and reading 	 	Most audiobooks are between 6 and 10 hours long some of them push upwards of 12 to 15 But even for longer books the total time is negligible when spread across weeks or months 	 	Consider the math once again: If you have a thirty-minute commute13 to work each way that is potentially an hour per day to listen to a book Or if you only want to listen in the morning for example thirty minutes of extra reading per day remains14 excellent  you could get through nearly two 8-hour audiobooks per month at thirty minutes a day I would be remiss15 to ignore the small faction16 of readers who do not count audiobooks as reading  So here is me addressing them Personally I do count audiobooks as reading  a book read aloud is still a book 	 	By implementing a regular time block for reading each day reading turns into a habit and becomes automated17 Thinking about when you can fit in time to read no longer applies once it becomes a routine part of your day Soon enough it becomes an integral piece of your identity as well  you see yourself as a reader and so do others which further motivates and compounds the habit of reading Next try out an audiobook Give yourself a month to listen to one book youll realize that you fly through the book much quicker than this Its a fun and leisurely18 way of reading more books And who doesnt like being read to by someone else 	 	With these two ideas you and me and everyone else can actually read more books
