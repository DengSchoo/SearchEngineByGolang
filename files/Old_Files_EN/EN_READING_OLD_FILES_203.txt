From the window of my room I could see a tall cottonrose hibiscus In spring when green foliage1 was half hidden by mist the tree looked very enchanting2 dotted with red blossom This inspiring neighbor of mine often set my mind working I gradually regarded it as my best friend Nevertheless when I opened the window one morning to my amazement3 the tree was almost bare beyond recognition as a result of the storm ravages4 the night before Struck by the plight5 I was seized with a sadness at the thought all the blossom is doomed6 to fall I could not help sighing with emotion: the course of life never runs smooth for there are so many ups and downs twists and turns The vicissitudes7 of my life saw my beloved friends parting one after another Isnt it similar to the tree shedding its flowers in the wind This event faded from my memory as time went by One day after I came home from the countryside I found the room stuffy8 and casually9 opened the window Something outside caught my eye and dazzled me It was a plum tree all scarlet10 with blossom set off beautifully by the sunset The surprise discovery overwhelmed me with pleasure I wondered why I had no idea of some unyielding life sprouting11 over the fallen petals13 when I was grieving for the hibiscus When the last withered14 petal12 dropped all the joyful15 admiration16 for the hibiscus sank into oblivion as if nothing was left until the landscape was again ablaze17 with the red plum blossom to remind people of lifes alternation and continuance Cant it be said that life is actually a symphony a harmonious18 composition of loss and gain Standing19 by the window lost in thought for a long time I realized that no scenery in the world remains20 unchanged As long as you keep your heart basking21 in the sun every dawn will present a fine prospect22 for you to unfold and the world will always be about new hopes ays be about new hopes tato an egg or a coffee bean 	 	Moral: In life things happen around us things happen to us but the only thing that truly matters is what happens within us 	 	Which one are you 	 kely that you will know exactly what you want to do  Be willing to dive into a job that might not be a perfect fit  and learn from it  
	 
	Take risks
	 
	Your early twenties are the best time to take risks  When you are older with more responsibilities  taking risks will be much more difficult  When you are young with fewer responsibilities  however  it is easier to travel  try new things  and explore your options  Go with your gut5  and be willing to take a leap  You are in a special time in your career that you might not be able to take advantage of in the future  If you have an inclination6 to take a risky7 job  move somewhere new  or deviate8 from your path--now is the time to do it  
	 
	Be friendly
	 
	Once you graduate college  you will no longer be surrounded by your peers at all hours of the day  Meeting new people is more challenging and requires more effort than it did during college  Because of this  it's often good to remember that being friendly is the best way to meet new people  Take interest in the lives of your coworkers and people around you  and be willing to make new connections for him 
	 
	It turned out that the other kids had not done their own work-their parents had made their exhibits  As the judges went on their rounds  they found that these other kids couldn't answer their questions  Daniel answered every one  When the judges awarded the Albert Einstein Plaque11 for the best exhibit  they gave it to him 
	 
	By the time Daniel left for college he stood six feet tall and weighed 170 pounds  He was muscular and in superb condition  but he never pitched another inning  having given up baseball for English literature  I was sorry that he would not develop his athletic12 talent  but proud that he had made such a mature decision 
	 
	One day I told Daniel that the great failing in my life had been that I didn't take a year or two off to travel when I finished college  This is the best way  to my way of thinking  to broaden oneself and develop a larger perspective on life  Once I had married and begun working  I found that the dream of living in another culture had vanished 
	 
	Daniel thought about this  His friends said that he would be insane to put his career on hold  But he decided13 it wasn't so crazy  After graduation  he worked as a waiter at college  a bike messenger and a house painter  With the money he earned  he had enough to go to Paris 
	 
	The night before he was to leave  I tossed in bed  I was trying to figure out something to say  Nothing came to mind  Maybe  I thought  it wasn't necessary to say anything #p#    #e#
	 
	What does it matter in the course of a life-time if a father never tells a son what he really thinks of him  But as I stood before Daniel  I knew that it does matter  My father and I loved each other  Yet  I always regretted never hearing him put his feelings into words and never having the memory of that moment  Now  I could feel my palms sweat and my throat tighten14  Why is it so hard to tell a son something from the heart  My mouth turned dry  and I knew I would be able to get out only a few words clearly 
	 
	"Daniel " I said  "if I could have picked  I would have picked you "
	 
	That's all I could say  I wasn't sure he understood what I meant  Then he came toward me and threw his arms around me  For a moment  the world and all its people vanished  and there was just Daniel and me in our home by the sea 
	 
	He was saying something  but my eyes misted over  and I couldn't understand what he was saying  All I was aware of was the stubble on his chin as his face pressed against mine  And then  the moment ended  I went to work  and Daniel left a few hours later with his girlfriend 
	 
	That was seven weeks ago  and I think about him when I walk along the beach on weekends  Thousands of miles away  somewhere out past the ocean waves breaking on the deserted15 shore  he might be scurrying16 across Boulevard Saint Germain  strolling through a musty hallway of the Louvre  bending an elbow in a Left Bank café 
	 
	What I had said to Daniel was clumsy and trite17  It was nothing  And yet  it was everything
