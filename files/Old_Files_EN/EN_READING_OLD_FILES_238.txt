He was driving home one evening on a two lane country road Work in this small midwestern community was almost as slow as his beatup Pontiac But he never quit looking Ever since the factory closed hed been unemployed1 and with winter raging on the chill had finally hit home It was a lonely road Not very many people had a reason to be on it unless they were leaving Most of his friends had already left They had families to feed and dreams to fulfil But he stayed on After all this was where he buried his mother and father He was born here and he knew the country He could go down this road blind and tell you what was on either side and with his headlights not working which came in handy It was starting to get dark and light snow flurries were coming down Hed better get a move on You know he almost didnt see the old lady stranded2 on the side of the road But even in the dim light of day he could see she needed help So he pulled up in front of her Mercedes and got out His Pontiac was still sputtering3 when he approached her Even with the smile on his face she was worried No one had stopped to help for the last hour or so Was he going to hurt her He didnt look safe he looked poor and hungry He could see that she was frightened standing4 out there in the cold He knew how she felt It was that chill which only fear can put in you He said Im here to help you maam Why dont you wait in the car where its warm By the way my name is Bryan Well all she had was a flat tire but for an old lady that was bad enough Bryan crawled under the car looking for a place to put the jack5 skinning his knuckles6 a time or two Soon he was able to change the tire But he had to get dirty and his hands hurt As he was tightening7 up the lug8 nuts she rolled down the window and began to talk to him She told him that she was from St Louis and was only just passing through She couldnt thank him enough for coming to her aid Bryan just smiled as he closed her trunk She asked him how much she owed him Any amount would have been all right with her She had already imagined all the awful things that could have happened had he not stopped Bryan never thought twice about the money This was not a job to him This was helping9 someone in need and God knows there were plenty who had given him a hand in the past He had lived his whole life that way and it never occurred to him to act any other way He told her that if she really wanted to pay him back the next time she saw someone who needed help she could give that person the assistance that they needed and Bryan added  and think of me He waited until she started her car and drove off It had been a cold and depressing day but he felt good as he headed for home disappearing into the twilight10 A few miles down the road the lady saw a small cafe She went in to grab a bite to eat and take the chill off before she made the last leg of her trip home It was a dingy11 looking restaurant Outside were two old gas pumps The whole scene was unfamiliar12 to her The cash register was like the telephone of an out of work actor it didnt ring much Her waitress came over and brought a clean towel to wipe her wet hair She had a sweet smile one that even being on her feet for the whole day couldnt erase13 The lady noticed that the waitress was nearly eight months pregnant but she never let the strain and aches change her attitude The old lady wondered how someone who had so little could be so giving to a stranger Then she remembered Bryan After the lady finished her meal and the waitress went to get change for her hundred dollar bill the lady slipped right out the door She was gone by the time the waitress came back She wondered where the lady could be then she noticed something written on the napkin under which were 4 more 100 bills There were tears in her eyes when she read what the lady wrote It said:You dont owe me anything I have been there too Somebody once helped me out the way Im helping you If you really want to pay me back here is what you do: Do not let this chain of love end with you Well there were tables to clear sugar bowls to fill and people to serve but the waitress made it through another day That night when she got home from work and climbed into bed she was thinking about the money and what the lady had written How could the lady have known how much she and her husband needed it With the baby due next month it was going to be hard She knew how worried her husband was and as he lay sleeping next to her she gave him a soft kiss and whispered soft and low Everythings gonna be all right; I love you Bryan oft and low "Everything's gonna be all right; I love you Bryan " "rong sense of helplessness  She murmured in a stammered13 voice: " But  but Cousin he told me Star is a terrible place  a charity school  He said only children from poor family or unwanted children would be sent to charity school  He said I am a great trouble  and you fight a lot because of me  Now  you and dad don't want me any more  " She broke off  her breath came in short  hot gasps14 as if the courage she gathered to speak aloud those painful words suddenly collapsed15  " Never believe a single word from He  How could he put such silly things into your head " Her mother drew herself up and spoke16 in an assured voice  but I could sense a trace of annoyance17 and bewildering misery18 to creep into her tone  How complicated human's feelings and how easily to be detected  Without any more word  the mother wept the tears away from her daughter gently  and then imprint a kiss on her forehead  " You are so dear to me  I don't care what the others said  Don't worry  once everything settled down  I would fetch you as soon as possible " Her voice was lower than whisper  As if those words were only said to herself  not to anyone else  To cheer them up  the mother changed to a lighter19 subject: " You know  auntie Liu is a good violin teacher  You should learn it hard so you could play a song for me when I pick you up home " The word of home did some positive effects on my little master  She held me close to her chest and nodded heavily  But for some unknown reasons  my heart sunk down  The wild ecstasy20 I'd just experienced melt away  My master knew nothing about violin  Even she tried hard to learn to keep the promise with her mum  but without fond of music from her heart  she could not go far  The future  uncertain and unpredictable  seemed lay before me to the unknown darkness
