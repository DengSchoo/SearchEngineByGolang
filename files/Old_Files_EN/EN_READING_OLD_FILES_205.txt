My son Joey was born with club feet The doctors assured1 us that with treatment he would be able to walk normally2 but would never run very well The first three years of his life were spent in surgery3 casts4 and braces5 By the time he was eight you wouldnt know he had a problem when you saw him walk The children in our neighborhood ran around as most children do during play and Joey would jump right in and run and play too We never told him that he probably wouldnt be able to run as well as the other children So he didnt know In seventh grade he decided6 to go out for the crosscountry team Every day he trained with the team He worked harder and ran more than any of the others perhaps he sensed that the abilities that seemed to come naturally to so many others did not come naturally to him Although the entire team runs only the top seven runners have the potential to score points for the school We didnt tell him he probably would never make the team so he didnt know He continued to run four to five miles a day every day even the day he had a 103degree fever I was worried so I went to look for him after school I found him running all alone I asked him how he felt Okay he said He had two more miles to go The sweat7 ran down his face and his eyes were glassy from his fever Yet he looked straight ahead and kept running We never told him he couldnt run four miles with a 103degree fever So he didnt know Two weeks later the names of the team runners were called Joey was number six on the list Joey had made the team He was in seventh grade the other six team members were all eighthgraders We never told him he shouldnt expect to make the team We never told him he couldnt do it We never told him he couldnt do it so he didnt know He just did it n't do it so he didn't know He just did it  k Salary was dreadful but I thought it would be for the best "	 	"Was it " I asked 	 	"No When I returned they'd moved Left no forwarding address "ch are you   he asked his daughter   When adversity knocks on your door  how do you respond  Are you a potato  an egg  or a coffee bean   	 	Moral: In life  things happen around us  things happen to us  but the only thing that truly matters is what happens within us 	 	Which one are you 	 d him 
	 
	"Give yourself a chance  Don't give up on your life " Nothing 
	 
	"Steve  Please  I care about you "
	 
	Wow  Suddenly  Steve got it   Someone cared about him  Someone  totally unattainable and perfect  CARED ABOUT HIM    
	 
	Steve went home from school  thoughtful  that afternoon  Walking into the house  he took one look around  Both parents were passed out  in various stages of undress  and the stench was overpowering  He  quickly  gathered up his camping gear  a jar of peanut butter  a loaf of bread  a bottle of water  and this time   his schoolbooks  Grim faced and determined7  he headed for the woods 
	 
	The following Monday he arrived at school on time  and he waited for Miss White to enter the classroom  She walked in  all sparkle and smiles  God  she was beautiful  He yearned8 for her smile to turn on him  It did not 
	 
	Miss White  immediately  gave a quiz on the weekend homework  Steve hurried through the test  and was the first to hand in his paper  With a look of surprise  Miss White took his paper  Obviously puzzled  she began to look it over  Steve walked back to his desk  his heart pounding within his chest  As he sat down  he couldn't resist another look at the lovely woman 
	 
	Miss White's face was in total shock  She glanced up at Steve  then down  then up 
	 
	Suddenly  her face broke into a radiant smile  The smartest boy in the seventh grade had just passed his first test 
	 
	From that moment nothing was the same for Steve  Life at home remained the same  but life still changed  He discovered that not only could he learn  but he was good at it 
	 
	He discovered that he could understand and retain knowledge  and that he could translate the things he learned into his own life  Steve began to excel  And he continued this course throughout his school life 
	 
	After high-school Steve enlisted9 in the Navy  and he had a successful military career  During that time  he met the love of his life  he raised a family  and he graduated from college Magna Cum Laude  During his Naval10 career  he inspired many young people  who without him  might not have believed in themselves  Steve began a second career after the Navy  and he continues to inspire others  as an adjunct professor in a nearby college Miss White left a great legacy11  She saved one boy who has changed many lives 
	 
	You see  it's simple  really  A change took place within the heart of one boy  all because of one teacher  who cared
