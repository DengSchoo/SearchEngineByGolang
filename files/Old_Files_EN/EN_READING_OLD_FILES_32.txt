In college I encountered a rule of thumb: For every credit hour per week you should be studying two to three hours outside of class per week 23If you ask a teacher or professor how much their best students should study very few will expect their students to be studying for long hours everyday As a T A at a university I can tell you that spending an hour of selfstudying for every credit hour will put you ahead of a lot of your peers 1Studying for long hours will often be necessary when you have an exam But you dont need to pull allnighters to be a top student Plus psychologists say a healthy amount of sleep will actually help you retain the material My best students are the ones who find time to complete portions of the assignment well before its due Studying all day might mean going to class reading 10 pages before lunch doing a physics problem in between classes and reviewing material at the end of the day 10The hardest part can often be thinking of small things to do in order to fill your time during the day A to do list item like Write essay is the kind of thing that will take long hours of work but it can be broken into steps like: write an outline free write revise your intro paragraph Theres no strict hours that a student should have to study to be the topper of the class What I believe is you need to act smartly instead of following what every one else is doing Lets talk about some of the study tips :1 Prepare summary notes Topper students are not ahead of intelligence or mental skill But they are ahead of time They manage time so well that they wont need to feel guilt1 after exams that they could have done better Summary notes mainly incorporates all important definitions points or flowcharts which are more likely to come in exams 2 This might look opposite of what you have heard till now But studying for more hours are less productive and effective than studying for less time along with adequate breaks in between 3 Distractions2 They make you less productive and lazy Keep a check on your distractions For example: Facebook FB will be keep you stick to its website and keep showing you funny videos profile pictures But just know one thing ANY OF THESE THINGS WONT MAKE YOU TOPPER 4 Writing Writing things down will help you remember them for more longer period Write everything that can come in examinations Disclaimer: Your mind will try to tell you that theres no need to write everything BUT YOU HAVE TO can come in examinations 		 	Disclaimer: Your mind will try to tell you that there's no need to write everything BUT YOU HAVE TO 	ily electrostatic energy therapy, towards our home in Ibabao.
