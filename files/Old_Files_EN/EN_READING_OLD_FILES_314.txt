but he snored on and did not stir hand or foot: so they thought they were quite safe  Then the eldest went up to her own bed and clapped her hands and the bed sank into the floor and a trap-door flew open The soldier saw them going down through the trap-door one after another the eldest leading the way; and thinking he had no time to lose he jumped up put on the cloak which the old woman had given him and followed them  However in the middle of the stairs he trod10 on the gown of the youngest princess and she cried out to her sisters "All is not right; someone took hold of my gown " "You silly creature " said the eldest "it is nothing but a nail in the wall " Down they all went and at the bottom they found themselves in a most delightful11 grove12 of trees; and the leaves were all of silver and glittered13 and sparkled14 beautifully The soldier wished to take away some token15 of the place; so he broke off a little branch and there came a loud noise from the tree Then the youngest daughter said again "I am sure all is not right -- did not you hear that noise That never happened before "#p##e# But the eldest said "It is only our princes who are shouting for joy at our approach " They came to another grove of trees where all the leaves were of gold; and afterwards to a third where the leaves were all glittering16 diamonds And the soldier broke a branch from each; and every time there was a loud noise which made the youngest sister tremble with fear But the eldest still said it was only the princes who were crying for joy  They went on till they came to a great lake; and at the side of the lake there lay twelve little boats with twelve handsome princes in them who seemed to be waiting there for the princesses  One of the princesses went into each boat and the soldier stepped into the same boat as the youngest As they were rowing over the lake the prince who was in the boat with the youngest princess and the soldier said "I do not know why it is but though I am rowing with all my might we do not get on so fast as usual and I am quite tired: the boat seems very heavy today " "It is only the heat of the weather " said the princess "I am very warm too " On the other side of the lake stood a fine illuminated17 castle from which came the merry music of horns and trumpets18 There they all landed and went into the castle and each prince danced with his princess; and the soldier who was still invisible danced with them too When any of the princesses had a cup of wine set by her he drank it all up so that when she put the cup to her mouth it was empty At this too the youngest sister was terribly frightened but the eldest always silenced her  They danced on till three o'clock in the morning and then all their shoes were worn out so that they were obliged to leave The princes rowed them back again over the lake (but this time the soldier placed himself in the boat with the eldest princess); and on the opposite shore they took leave of each other the princesses promising19 to come again the next night  When they came to the stairs the soldier ran on before the princesses and laid himself down And as the twelve tired sisters slowly came up they heard him snoring in his bed and they said "Now all is quite safe" Then they undressed themselves put away their fine clothes pulled off their shoes and went to bed  In the morning the soldier said nothing about what had happened but determined to see more of this strange adventure and went again on the second and third nights Everything happened just as before: the princesses danced till their shoes were worn to pieces and then returned home On the third night the soldier carried away one of the golden cups as a token of where he had been  As soon as the time came when he was to declare the secret he was taken before the king with the three branches and the golden cup; and the twelve princesses stood listening behind the door to hear what he would say  The king asked him "Where do my twelve daughters dance at night " The soldier answered "With twelve princes in a castle underground " And then he told the king all that had happened and showed him the three branches and the golden cup which he had brought with him  The king called for the princesses and asked them whether what the soldier said was true and when they saw that they were discovered and that it was of no use to deny what had happened they confessed it all  So the king asked the soldier which of the princesses he would choose for his wife; and he answered "I am not very young so I will have the eldest " -- and they were married that very day and the soldier was chosen to be the king's heir1
