You cant cross the same river twice the popular saying goes This wisdom reminds us that everything changes expecting to relive your bygone days of success in the same way is unrealistic But apparently1 this doesnt apply to music Over the last decade or so for one reason or another a number of highprofile bands have decided2 to stop resting on their laurels3 and have reunited But why Earlier this year rock band Genesis confirmed that they will reconvene for one more tour In November 2019 the Pussycat Dolls announced a slew4 of tour dates for April 2020 In 2018 it was the Spice Girls comeback The list goes on Many bands have found new success in their resurrected form American alternative rock band The Pixies originally broke up in 1993 after playing for seven years After an elevenyear hiatus the band reunited in 2004 and have not stopped In some cases its financial reasons that made them go back on the road Touring these days is far more lucrative5 than it used to be according to Kara Weisenstein of online publisher Mic This is because ticket prices have risen to compensate6 for the piracy7 that weakened music sales in the 90s according to online publisher Bloomberg People are really into nostalgia8 right now Lance Bass9 member of former band NSYNC told Variety magazine When The Pixies reformed their 2004 comeback tour sold out within minutes Is it possible that those teenage fans of yore have grown into nostalgic adults wistful for their youth Bass thinks so I think fans just want to feel that innocence10 and excitement again he says But not everybody thinks that these reunions are a good thing Theres something noble in not trying to go after past glories says NME writer Leonie Cooper As much as I love ABBA the fact they refused to risk putting on a show that might not match the excellence11 of their heyday12 is pretty impressive Should bands reunite Opinion is divided If things dont go well they run the risk of being labelled hasbeens and tarnishing13 their reputation But if their sound is as good as it ever was and the fans are happy then whos going to complain After all you can never have too much of a good thing  you can never have too much of a good thing r but only on her few "good" days 		 	She died on a cold Winter's day with heavy snow falling down like teardrops from sky 		 	In spite of the short time we had together		 	I learned so much from Kai		 	about how to truly live all the days we are given here 		 	Lessons on kindness generosity7  hope and good cheer seemed to flow freely from her daily life 		 	I think most of all she taught me that joy like love is quite contagious8		 	and that I should always strive to be a carrier of them both 		 	May the same be said for all of us 		 	Thanks Kai 	piness double-check to make sure you're not looking in all these wrong places           。
	Too often  when we’re cohabiting  we locate the difficulty of our relationships in a very erroneous place:
	   ，                 。
	
		We think that it is the wrong person we’ve mistakenly got together with 
	
		             ，
	
		rather than keeping in mind that we’re with a pretty right person trying to do an exceptionally tricky8 thing: share a home 
	
		               ，             。
	
		It may in the end – strangely – just be a lot easier to love than to share a bathroom
