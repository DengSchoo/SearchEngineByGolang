I love you Bryan " to ask You anything more  I would be sweet to him  I would be gay  I would be just the way I used to be  and then he would love me again  And then I would never have to ask You for anything more  Don't You see  God  So won't You please let him telephone me  Won't You please  please  please #p##e# Are You punishing me  God  because I've been bad  Are You angry with me because I did that  Oh  but  God  there are so many bad people  You could not be hard only to me  And it wasn't very bad; it couldn't have been bad  We didn't hurt anybody  God  Things are only bad when they hurt people  We didn't hurt one single soul; You know that  You know it wasn't bad  don't You  God So won't You let him telephone me now  If he doesn't telephone me  I'll know God is angry with me  I'll count five hundred by fives  and if he hasn't called me then  I will know God isn't going to help me  ever again  That will be the sign  Five  ten  fifteen  twenty  twenty-five  thirty  thirty-five  forty  forty-five  fifty  fifty-five    It was bad  I knew it was bad  All right  God  send me to hell  You think You're frightening me with Your hell  don't You  You think  Your hell is worse than mine  I mustn't  I mustn't do this  Suppose he's a little late calling me up  that's nothing to get hysterical6 about Maybe he isn't going to call  maybe he's coming straight up here without telephoning  He'll be cross10 if he sees I have been crying  They don't like you to cry  He doesn't cry  I wish to God I could make him cry  I wish I could make him cry and tread7 the floor and feel his heart heavy and big and festering in him  I wish I could hurt him like hell  He doesn't wish that about me  I don't think he even knows how he makes me feel  I wish he could know  without my telling him  They don't like you to tell them they've made you cry  They don't like you to tell them you're unhappy because of them  If you do  they think you're possessive and exacting8  And then they hate you  They hate you whenever you say anything you really think  You always have to keep playing little games  Oh  I thought we didn't have to; I thought this was so big I could say whatever I meant  I guess you can't  ever  I guess there isn't ever anything big enough for that  Oh  if he would just telephone  I wouldn't tell him I had been sad about him  They hate sad people  I would be so sweet and so gay  he couldn't help but like me  If he would only telephone  If he would only telephone  Maybe that's what he is doing  Maybe he is coming on here without calling me up  Maybe he's on his way now  Something might have happened to him  No  nothing could ever happen to him  I can't picture anything happening to him  I never picture him run over  I never see him lying still and long and dead  I wish he were dead  That's a terrible wish  That's a lovely wish  If he were dead  he would be mine  If he were dead  I would never think of now and the last few weeks  I would remember only the lovely times  It would be all beautiful  I wish he were dead  I wish he were dead  dead  dead  This is silly  It's silly to go wishing people were dead just because they don't call you up the very minute they said they would  Maybe the clock's fast; I don't know whether it's right  Maybe he's hardly late at all  Anything could have made him a little late  Maybe he had to stay at his office  Maybe he went home  to call me up from there  and somebody came in  He doesn't like to telephone me in front of people  Maybe he's worried  just a little  little bit  about keeping me waiting  He might even hope that I would call him up  I could do that  I could telephone him  I mustn't  I mustn't  I mustn't  Oh  God  please don't let me telephone him  Please keep me from doing that  I know  God  just as well as You do  that if he were worried about me  he'd telephone no matter where he was or how many people there were around him  Please make me know that  God  I don't ask YOU to make it easy for me  You can't do that  for all that You could make a world  Only let me know it  God  Don't let me go on hoping  Don't let me say comforting things to myself  Please don't let me hope  dear God  Please don't  I won't telephone him  I'll never telephone him again as long as I live  He'll rot in hell  before I'll call him up  You don't have to give me strength  God; I have it myself  If he wanted me  he could get me  He knows where I am  He knows I'm waiting here  He's so sure of me  so sure  I wonder why they hate you  as soon as they are sure of you  I should think it would be so sweet to be sure  It would be so easy to telephone him  Then I'd know  Maybe it wouldn't be a foolish thing to do  Maybe he wouldn't mind  Maybe he'd like it  Maybe he has been trying to get me  Sometimes people try and try to get you on the telephone  and they say the number doesn't answer  I'm not just saying that to help myself; that really happens  You know that really happens  God  Oh  God  keep me away from that telephone  Keep me away  Let me still have just a little bit of pride  I think I'm going to need it  God  I think it will be all I'll have  Oh  what does pride matter  when I can't stand it if I don't talk to him  Pride like that is such a silly  shabby little thing  The real pride  the big pride  is in having no pride  I'm not saying that just because I want to call him  I am not  That's true  I know that's true  I will be big  I will be beyond little prides #p##e# Please  God  keep me from  telephoning him  Please  God  I don't see what pride has to do with it  This is such a little thing  for me to be bringing in pride  for me to be making such a fuss9 about  I may have misunderstood him  Maybe he said for me to call him up  at five  "Call me at five  darling " He could have said that  perfectly10 well  It's so possible that I didn't hear him right  "Call me at five  darling " I'm almost sure that's what he said  God  don't let me talk this way to myself  Make me know  please make me know  I'll think about something else  I'll just sit quietly  If I could sit still  If I could sit still  Maybe I could read  Oh  all the books are about people who love each other  truly and sweetly  What do they want to write about that for  Don't they know it isn't true  Don't they know it's a lie  it's a God damned lie  What do they have to tell about that for  when they know how it hurts  Damn them  damn them  damn them  I won't  I'll be quiet  This is nothing to get excited about  Look  Suppose he were someone I didn't know very well  Suppose he were another girl  Then I'd just telephone and say  "Well  for goodness' sake  what happened to you " That's what I'd do  and I'd never even think about it  Why can't I be casual and natural  just because I love him  I can be  Honestly  I can be  I'll call him up  and be so easy and pleasant  You see if I won't  God  Oh  don't let me call him  Don't  don't  don't  God  aren't You really going to let him call me  Are You sure  God  Couldn't You please relent  Couldn't You  I don't even ask You to let him telephone me this minute  God; only let him do it in a little while  I'll count five hundred by fives  I'll do it so slowly and so fairly  If he hasn't telephoned then  I'll call him  I will  Oh  please  dear God  dear kind God  my blessed Father in Heaven  let him call before then  Please  God  Please  Five  ten  fifteen  twenty  twenty-five  thirty  thirty-five
