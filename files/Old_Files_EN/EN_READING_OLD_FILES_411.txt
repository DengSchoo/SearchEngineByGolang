In the future days which we seek to make secure we look forward to a world founded upon four essential human freedoms  The first is freedom of speech and expression everywhere in the world  The second is freedom of every person to worship God in his own way everywhere in the world  The third is freedom from want which translated into world terms means economic understandings which will secure to every nation a healthy peacetime life for its inhabitants everywhere in the world  The fourth is freedom from fear -- which translated into world terms means a worldwide reduction of armaments to such a point and in such a thorough fashion that no nation will be in a position to commit an act of physical aggression1 against any neighbor -- anywhere in the world  That is no vision of a distant millennium2 It is a definite basis for a kind of world attainable3 in our own time and generation That kind of world is the very antithesis4 of the so-called "new order" of tyranny which the dictators seek to create with the crash of a bomb  To that new order we oppose the greater conception -- the moral order A good society is able to face schemes of world domination and foreign revolutions alike without fear  Since the beginning of our American history we have been engaged in change in a perpetual peaceful revolution a revolution which goes on steadily5 quietly adjusting itself to changing conditions without the concentration camp or the quicklime in the ditch The world order which we seek is the cooperation of free countries working together in a friendly civilized6 society  This nation has placed its destiny in the hands heads and hearts of its millions of free men and women and its faith in freedom under the guidance of God Freedom means the supremacy7 of human rights everywhere Our support goes to those who struggle to gain those rights and keep them Our strength is our unity8 of purpose  To that high concept there can be no end save victory hey're looking for someone who is going to be their partner not their leader  9 Ambitious girls know that being tough and being emotional aren't mutually exclusive Ambitious girls are strong confident and intelligent They know how to handle themselves But they're aware that that doesn't mean they can't be vulnerable or emotional One of the reasons they feel comfortable dating is because they know how to be tough without feeling the need to apologize for having emotions  10 A good conversation in their eyes doesn't revolve4 around how much money you make or how successful you are They're more interested in hearing what makes you tick what inspires you what gets your blood flowing and what you're passionate about  11 They know that sometimes they have a hard time opening up in the beginning They're used to being in control so when they're not it's a little disorienting But they enjoy the challenge of trying to get better so it's something they're always keen to work on  12 They won't ask you to choose between them and your other priorities because they're too busy having priorities of their own  13 Ambitious girls are attracted to people who have goals and aspirations5 - people who want more than an average existence They don't need you to be the CEO of a Fortune 500 or an insanely successful entrepreneur They just want to know you care about something that matters and are willing to work for it  14 They're not going to wait forever They'll let you know one way or another that they like you They're never in a rush to jump into a relationship but they're also practical about where they are in their lives and when it's time to move on If you like them do something about it  15 They're less worried about a fairytale romance and more concerned with finding someone who will simply make them happy They're not preoccupied6 with a huge diamond ring an over-the-top wedding and a ridiculous love story they can tell their friends They just want to be with someone who will love them for who they are and never ask them to stop following their dreams
