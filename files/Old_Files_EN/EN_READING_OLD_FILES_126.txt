Optimism isnt believing everything is great its believing that there is always will be a reason to be happy People wonder why Im so happy all the timeand take things in stride Im an optimist1 through and through I dont just think everything is awesome2 I have bad days like everyone else However I always believe there will be reason to be positivewhether Ive discovered it yet or not discovered it yet or not 	change our lives It's not a life-or-death situation if we don't have a TV or a recliner chair People want these inventions because they make their lives easier Now the more you have the less work you have to do For example plenty of people live their whole lives without a microwave There are lots of other ways to cook your food but who wants to expend1 the effort if they don't have to Wouldn't you rather just press a button and wait two minutes Of course my point is that laziness and innovation go hand in hand and not just because customers are lazy Inventors are often the laziest people out there We'll just look at Benjamin Franklin He famously called himself the laziest man in the world He said he would invent things simply to save himself a little bit of time and effort He was tired of working so hard when he went swimming so he invented flippers He only created bifocals because he was too lazy to switch between different pairs of glasses Lazy people make fantastic inventors since they're always looking for the fastest and most efficient way to get things done Their laziness motivates them to find creative solutions They'll improve streamline2 and automate3 so they can spend less time doing things that they don't like You can and should use your laziness the same way When you're unwilling4 to do something start looking for ways to save time Not only is it more fun but you'll also find yourself more motivated to succeed Think of it like driving to work in the morning Now your normal route may only take you thirty minutes but there's nothing you hate more than sitting in traffic so you discover a shortcut5 You realize if you cut down a few side streets that you can completely skip the usual congestion6 Even if you only end up saving say five minutes your commute7 will feel significantly shorter and more exciting Finding a workaround also gives you a unique sense of accomplishment8 It feels good to know that you're working smarter and not harder So the next time you're not in the mood to work use that laziness to your advantage 	230 5	 	Number two listen to your thoughts 		 	Even when you're avoiding your responsibilities your mind is actively9 thinking about them You may discover you have a hard time enjoying whatever you're distracting yourself with Your mind is too focused on your laziness to prioritize anything else You end up feeling irritated and guilty because as much as you want to forget well you can't People are laziest when they're in denial Imagine you have a paper due next week In the back of your mind you know it's gonna be a ton of work You still have to gather sources find quotes write your thesis you know the list goes on and on Yet here you are spending hours on social media You convince yourself you still have plenty of time but your gut10 is telling you otherwise Whenever you continue thinking about one thing it means it's time to get started Not tomorrow not in a few hours right now Because this thought isn't just popping up out of nowhere It's the productive part of your brain telling you the right thing to do So don't try to block it out with TV or video games You can use the same trick when you have a completely packed to-do list If you're struggling to figure out what to do first tackle the task that you can't stop thinking about The longer you try to ignore it the more frustrated11 you're gonna feel You'll never feel satisfied until you get that big-ticket item out of your head 		 	Number three the power of reliability12 		 	Even if you're great about setting new goals you may have a hard time following through You might make a to-do list and lay out specific concrete steps but what stops you from bailing14 at the last minute Let's say you want to start working out You research exercises you buy gym clothes and you even get a gym membership Yet you never actually show up You end up watching TV or playing video games because well you can If you decide to skip the gym for the tenth time you're not affecting anyone but yourself There's no one there to hold you accountable You should use reliability to motivate yourself to do things that you normally wouldn't So the next time you plan on going to the gym ask one of your friends to meet you there That way someone else will be counting on you to show up They'll expect you to follow through so if you don't you won't get off scot-free like you did before Reliability is effective for a number of reasons but trust is a big one You show up because you don't want to blow off your friend You invited them to the gym so you can't just bail13 because you're feeling lazy Sitting around watching Netflix is a pretty terrible reason to damage a friendship Reliability also motivates you because you want your friend to think highly of you You want them to see you as someone who takes their goals seriously So when you're on your own it's easier to fail because no one has to know about it Your friends and family won't have a different opinion of you if you don't go But now your friend will see firsthand whether you're following through or not So you show up to make sure you leave a good impression For the same reason you're more likely to actually try while you're there You can't just leave after five minutes or sit on your phone the whole time Sitting there watching your friend do what they're supposed to do will motivate you to follow suit Finally reliability can make things more fun It gives you someone to talk to which relieves anxiety and stress Your friend might also be more experienced so they can help you get the most out of whatever you're doing If you're struggling to find motivation on your own hey there's no shame in calling for backup The simple fact that someone else is involved will jumpstart your work ethic15 	105	 	Number four undermine your fears 		 	Sometimes our laziness isn't really laziness You might procrastinate16 or avoid doing something because well you're worried about what will happen when you try You might have set your expectations way too high You might feel an overwhelming amount of pressure to succeed This can make even the smallest chores feel like huge responsibilities You end up running away because you can't fail at something that you never actually do Now to avoid this kind of laziness check your expectations at the door In other words when you start a project you only have one job and that's to start Don't be afraid of making something terrible just begin working on the first thing that pops into your mind This gets you past that initial roadblock Every project is way less intimidating17 when you're already halfway18 done This is the same reason that teachers encourage their students to write rough drafts You make something rough and imperfect to get an idea of where you're headed Yeah it won't be very good because it's not supposed to be There aren't any expectations or pressure but you'll find that things seem a lot more doable afterwards So when you're feeling lazy don't be afraid to get a little messy Improving something bad's a whole lot easier than making something perfect from scratch 		 	Number five dress for productivity 		 	Where are you the laziest Well if you're like most people you probably feel lethargic19 whenever you're trying to work or study in your room And your clothes maybe the biggest reason why Now everyone knows it's a whole lot more comfortable to work in sweatpants or pajamas20 If you're gonna spend all day doing something that you don't want to you might as well be comfy right The truth is your clothes can directly affect your habits This is one of the biggest reasons why so many companies make their employees dress up for work even if they aren't interacting with customers Your brain naturally associates your habits with your environment Think about studying in your room versus21 studying in the library the latter is way more efficient because your brain doesn't see your room as a workspace So when you're in your room your brain unconsciously thinks about relaxation22 and sleep because that's what it's used to doing But the library puts you in a different mental space this new environment primes your brain to work and think harder than it would anywhere else Clothes work the exact same way What are you usually doing when you wear sweatpants Chances are you aren't taking tests or going to meetings you're probably playing video games or watching TV So that's what your brain thinks about when you're wearing them The lazier your clothes are the lazier you'll feel To overcome this kind of laziness change into clothes that help you focus Don't worry you don't have to wear a suit and tie You should choose something you wouldn't mind wearing out into the world This is an especially helpful tip for students and people who work from home Yeah it's tempting23 to lounge around all day in your comfiest outfit24 but you need to tell your brain when it's time to shift gears A change of clothing is an easy and effective way to do just that
