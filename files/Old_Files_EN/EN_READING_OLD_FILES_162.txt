I wrote your name in the sand but the waves washed it away I wrote your name in the sky but the wind blew it away I wrote your name in my heart and forever it will stay Recently the film Your Name shows in the mainland which is so popular among the younger Like a landscape shining after heavy rain it feels like real life with the sharpness brightness1 and sensation2 turned right up Teenage Mitsuha is bored with her life in rural Japan; Taki is a boy in heroines age living in Tokyo Just a few times a week itsunexpectedly that they wake up in each others bodies They have to navigate3 their everyday lives without knowing where to find anything or who anybody is While in the end Taki decides to search for Mistuha and Mistuha attends to do the same Finally they find out they dont live in the same time during the bodyswap To avoid forgetting about each other Mitsuha lets write down our names However their memories about each other have been wiped awayunavoidably Eight years later Taki cant figure out why he was drawn4 to Itomori he cant understand why he was so obsessed5 with the stories happened there Once in a while I find myself crying when I wake upMitsuha once said I can never recall the dreams that I must have had The sensation that Ive lost something lingers6 for a long time after I wake up Taki once said Your Name this film is a tale of what happens to a boy and girl who are destined7 to meet Neither one knows it yet but somewhere out there is a person they are bound to care deeply about And it seems like we have been searching for something that even we cant remember The rhythm of modern city life is always very fast We are allnighters for coming meetingssometimes run off our feet for our presentations On the street we hurry for all directionsand we are too busy to dress up for a datehaving difficulty in moving on and starting a new relationship It has been such a long time that we gradually get used to be alone We finally grow up to be the men and women that weve always dreamt of since our childhood but somehow we are mature enough and behave like the robots that without feelings and love In a relationship we are supposed to be simple instead we play tricks and wrap other around our little fingers We lay emphasis on receiving and losing that we are afraid of giving Falling in love is supposed to humans instinct but the situation doesnt appear the same Girls and boys who burst into tears in rain now calmly let tears run down from their eyes tell themselves theyve got work to do tomorrow Neverthelesssome are willing to hold dear to love At the moment Mitsuha and Taki met with each other tears welled from our eyes What had caught my interest so much is now a mystery to me But at a point I was inexplicably8 drawn to the events surrounding that comet9 I feel like I am always searching for something for someone She liked him so her heart was hurt deeply when he went for the date that she designed He adored10 her so he spared no efforts to save her life when he knew she would die for the fall of the comet Sadly although he kept repeating her name he still forgot it Although he failed to write down her name the I love you remained on her hand Perhaps there are bounds between peoplewhich is hard to explain When Taki turned around to ask Mitsuha whether they had met before they asked at the same time whats your name It might be a fiction story but the feeling is true Your Name is cure for those who have lost faith in true love Whenever we are overwhelmed11 by some invisible pressure we crave12 for the love we once had we crave for the person that we once eat dinner and watch movies together We all need someone to share things with in our life We are on a great journey We need someone to be there for us when we are tired and want to give up Whenever we realize that there is someone we miss so much deep inside take a deep breath and carry on for I believe there is always a shelter for my soul So there are plenty of strong minded people who are brave enough to fight for love once more time no matter what they met before or how heartbroken they were All the seeking is for happiness See among all these people we are able to find each other For this time I strongly believe that there will be the one who keeps searching for us from dawn to dusk To you please believe that we must reunite in the future even if I forget your name One thing is certain If we see each other we will know lieve that we must reunite in the future even if I forget your name One thing is certain If we see each other we will know 	ow 	 sky  and raindrops will start pitter-pattering  Soon when the rain is over  the clouds begin gradually to roll towards the west and the sun comes out in the blue sky  Some idle townsfolk  wearing lined or unlined clothing made of thick cloth  will come out pipe in mouth and  loitering under a tree by the end of a bridge  exchange leisurely conversation with acquaintances with a slight touch of regret at the passing of time:
	 
	“ ，     ——”“    ？        ！”
	"Oh  real nice and cool—"
	"Sure  Getting cooler with each autumn shower "

	Fruit trees in the North also make a wonderful sight in autumn  Take jujube tree for example  They grow everywhere—around the corner of a house  at the foot of a wall  by the side of a latrine or outside a kitchen door  It is at the height of autumn that jujubes  shaped like dates or pigeon eggs  make their appearance in a light yellowish-green amongst tiny elliptic leaves  By the time when they have turned ruddy and the leaves fallen  the north-westerly wind will begin to reign32 supreme33 and make a dusty world of the North  Only at the turn of July and August when jujubes  persimmons  grapes are 80-90 percent ripe will the North have the best of autumn—the golden days in a year

	Some literary critics say that Chinese literati  especially poets  are mostly disposed to be decadent34  which accounts for predominance of Chinese works singing the praises of autumn  Well  the same is true of foreign poets  isn't it  I haven't read much of foreign poetry and prose  nor do I want to enumerate35 autumn-related poems and essays in foreign literature  But  if you browse36 through collected works of English  German  French or Italian poets  or various countries' anthologies of poetry or prose  you can always comes across a great many literary pieces eulogizing or lamenting37 autumn  Long pastoral poems or songs about the four seasons by renowned38 poets are mostly distinguished39 by beautiful moving lines on autumn  All that goes to show that all live creatures and sensitive humans alike are prone40 to the feeling of depth  remoteness  severity and bleakness41

	Not only poets  even convicts in prison  I suppose  have deep sentiments in autumn in spite of themselves  Autumn treats all humans alike  regardless of nationality  race or class  However  judging from Chinese idiom qiushi (autumn scholar  meaning and aged42 scholar grieving over frustrations43 in his life) and frequent selection in textbooks of Ouyang Xiu's On the Autumn Sough and Su Dongpo's On the Red Cliff  Chinese men of letters seem to be particularly autumn-minded  But  to know the real flavour of autumn  especially China's autumn  one has to visit the North

	Autumn in the South also has its unique features  such as the moonlit Ershisi Bridge in Yangzhou  the flowing sea tide at the Qiantangjiang River  the mist-shrouded Putuo Mountain and lotuses at the Lizhiwan Bay  But they all lack strong colour and lingering flavour  Southern autumn is to Northern autumn what yellow rice wine is to kaoliang wine  congee44 to steamed buns  perches45 to crabs46  yellow dogs to camels

	Autumn  I mean Northern autumn  if only it could be made to last forever  I would be more than willing to keep but one-third of my life-span and have two-thirds of it bartered47 for the prolonged stay of the season
