In our societies we used the word success a lot And we think we know just what it means: money status fame and power But take a look at the dictionary and things start to look thankfully a lot more complicated because success is in truth rather more neutral and less valueladen than we tend to assume It just means doing anything well excelling at something and that might encompass1 a lot of different activity: running 100 meters for sure selling your app for a lot of money okay but also stranger less heralded2 things like listening a lot very attentively3 to a child or being extremely kind to strangers or filling your mind with interesting ideas and associations or knowing just when to put an arm around someone when its too much for them People who triumph here are also big success stories app No one can be successful at everything; whatever they tell us its almost impossible to succeed with a career and a family or with popularity and integrity There are always sacrifices Its great to be successful Its even better to make sure you followed your own distinctive4 and not necessarily always obvious path to the success that can truly fulfill5 you  can truly fulfill5 you 	d question why I needed the money and I believe huff a little bit as she wrote out the check I gave creative speeches about how much AP would save me at college and that those $22 would be parlayed into thousands of dollars of tuition money 	2222	 	By the time senior year rolled around  I sent out only two applications for college one to the state university a little more than two hours away from my hometown and one to a school in another state I was quickly accepted into both but this was the point at which l felt somewhat blindsided by my parents My dad at least seemed to be against the idea of my going away for school He wanted me to attend the extension in our county and save money by continuing to live at home 		 	The mere3 thought of staying home another two years was enough to turn my stomach  I was already attending some classes at "The Stench " because my high school didn't offer the accelerated classes I qualified4 for Although it was a fine school and many people did transfer from the extension to the main state school I knew I wouldn't follow that path 		 	For whatever reason I had been given more ambition than my parents before me or my two younger brothers both of whom opted5 for the factory scene rather than education But I could see this ambition having an ending point as if it were mistakenly siphoned into me and would be sucked out if I spent too much time in my small town I could see in my mind's eye how discouraged I would get living at home for two more years under my parents' ironclad rule either getting frustrated6 at the extension or finding more value in the attention from boys ending up pregnant and working at the nearby gas station Not my idea of a future 	 	 	So every day after school my dad and I had blown out fights about where I would go to college His logic7 was very sound especially considering where I stand now three years after graduation with debt up to my eyeballs  but I just knew l would get nowhere staying in my hometown He threatened to give me no financial help at all and I said that was fine I would be able to get enough loans 	 	 	Eventually I signed my family up for a tour of the state university My dad and I toured campus and even though it was very cold my dad fell in love - or at the very least seemed very enthusiastic about every corner of the campus 		 	I could tell he was softened8 by this visit but the fights about where I was going to get the money continued until the day I packed everything up into our minivan  It was then at breakfast before we made our journey down that my dad said he was proud of me He hadn't thought I would actually leave and he was impressed As my parents dropped me off at my dorm room my mom started crying hysterically9  and even my dad teared up kissing me on the forehead which was the first time I could remember getting hugged and kissed by them in years 		 	At this point my relationship with my parents changed No longer were they the disciplinarians but they became confidants  advisors10 and an excellent support system and I became an adult Sometimes I still expect to get yelled at for my decisions but they've done phenomenally well to leave me to my own life and to just be happy when I actually call home No matter what happens now I know standing11 my ground on where to go for school has been the best decision of my life as I have gained both a good education and a precious life experience I never would have been exposed to had I taken any other road 	                                     	 	I could tell he was softened8 by this visit  but the fights about where I was going to get the money continued until the day I packed everything up into our minivan   It was then  at breakfast before we made our journey down  that my dad said he was proud of me  He hadn't thought I would actually leave  and he was impressed  As my parents dropped me off at my dorm room  my mom started crying hysterically9   and even my dad teared up  kissing me on the forehead  which was the first time I could remember getting hugged and kissed by them in years 	                                                                                                                                                                                 	 	At this point  my relationship with my parents changed  No longer were they the disciplinarians but they became confidants   advisors10 and an excellent support system  and I became an adult  Sometimes I still expect to get yelled at for my decisions  but they've done phenomenally well to leave me to my own life  and to just be happy when I actually call home  No matter what happens now  I know standing11 my ground on where to go for school has been the best decision of my life  as I have gained both a good education and a precious life experience I never would have been exposed to had I taken any other road 	                                                                                                                                                                                                                    They'll expect you to follow through  so if you don't you won't get off scot-free like you did before  Reliability is effective for a number of reasons  but trust is a big one  You show up because you don't want to blow off your friend  You invited them to the gym so you can't just bail13 because you're feeling lazy  Sitting around watching Netflix is a pretty terrible reason to damage a friendship  Reliability also motivates you because you want your friend to think highly of you  You want them to see you as someone who takes their goals seriously  So when you're on your own it's easier to fail because no one has to know about it  Your friends and family won't have a different opinion of you if you don't go  But now your friend will see firsthand whether you're following through or not  So you show up to make sure you leave a good impression  For the same reason you're more likely to actually try while you're there  You can't just leave after five minutes or sit on your phone the whole time  Sitting there watching your friend do what they're supposed to do will motivate you to follow suit  Finally  reliability can make things more fun  It gives you someone to talk to which relieves anxiety and stress  Your friend might also be more experienced so they can help you get the most out of whatever you're doing  If you're struggling to find motivation on your own  hey  there's no shame in calling for backup  The simple fact that someone else is involved will jumpstart your work ethic15

	Sometimes our laziness isn't really laziness  You might procrastinate16 or avoid doing something because well you're worried about what will happen when you try  You might have set your expectations way too high  You might feel an overwhelming amount of pressure to succeed  This can make even the smallest chores feel like huge responsibilities  You end up running away because you can't fail at something that you never actually do  Now to avoid this kind of laziness  check your expectations at the door  In other words  when you start a project  you only have one job and that's to start  Don't be afraid of making something terrible  just begin working on the first thing that pops into your mind  This gets you past that initial roadblock  Every project is way less intimidating17 when you're already halfway18 done  This is the same reason that teachers encourage their students to write rough drafts  You make something rough and imperfect to get an idea of where you're headed  Yeah it won't be very good because it's not supposed to be  There aren't any expectations or pressure  but you'll find that things seem a lot more doable afterwards  So when you're feeling lazy  don't be afraid to get a little messy  Improving something bad's a whole lot easier than making something perfect from scratch

	Where are you the laziest  Well if you're like most people you probably feel lethargic19 whenever you're trying to work or study in your room  And your clothes maybe the biggest reason why  Now everyone knows it's a whole lot more comfortable to work in sweatpants or pajamas20  If you're gonna spend all day doing something that you don't want to  you might as well be comfy  right  The truth is your clothes can directly affect your habits  This is one of the biggest reasons why so many companies make their employees dress up for work  even if they aren't interacting with customers  Your brain naturally associates your habits with your environment  Think about studying in your room versus21 studying in the library  the latter is way more efficient  because your brain doesn't see your room as a workspace  So when you're in your room  your brain unconsciously thinks about relaxation22 and sleep  because that's what it's used to doing  But the library puts you in a different mental space  this new environment primes your brain to work and think harder than it would anywhere else  Clothes work the exact same way  What are you usually doing when you wear sweatpants  Chances are you aren't taking tests or going to meetings  you're probably playing video games or watching TV  So that's what your brain thinks about when you're wearing them  The lazier your clothes are  the lazier you'll feel  To overcome this kind of laziness  change into clothes that help you focus  Don't worry  you don't have to wear a suit and tie  You should choose something you wouldn't mind wearing out into the world  This is an especially helpful tip for students and people who work from home  Yeah it's tempting23 to lounge around all day in your comfiest outfit24  but you need to tell your brain when it's time to shift gears  A change of clothing is an easy and effective way to do just that
