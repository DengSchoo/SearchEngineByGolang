Life comes from life The universe is a living thing made by love and of love The earth too as part of the universe is a living thing made of love We experience her love in the abundance of support she provides us such as the air we breathe the water we drink and the food we eat And we recognize the divinity of her unconditional1 love and so call her mother earth or some of us refer to her as goddess We must recognize as well that we too spring from universal love and as such carry a spark of the divine within each and everyone of us  Ladies and gentleman  We are here today to witness and celebrate a passage of life a passage of love which Ariele and Martin have chosen to enter upon They have decided2 to become more than just lovers but a family Moving from onstage of life to another You have been invited to be physical representatives of the divine and give your support to their union so as to help make their new path a joyous3 one one that is walked upon with wonder and ease For truly whether we recognize it or not we are all family all of the time Therefore we deeply thank you for your presence as we thank the goddess herself for being with us always  This celebration is not and end but a beginning the start of a new process From my experience it is not the marriage ceremony nor the marriage that is important but the love and friendship that you share Those will ensure a longer lasting4 relationship than any ritual  With all my heart I bless you and trust that all will go well in your new life together My love goes with you as I am sure everyone else's love in this place goes with you as sell Goddess be with you Blessed be for my mistake  There is a time and a place for humor If we run around laughing in a church when someone just died we might offend (I've always hoped people would laugh at my funeral though)  Here are 5 ways to incorporate more laughter (and more power of HA) into your life: If you feel goofy let it out  Feel free to encourage someone through laughing with them  Watch more comedies than tragedies (or certainly than horror)  Listen to music or read a book that makes you laugh  Start laughing for no reason at all (ok be careful where you try this one - don't want you to get locked away ) really found themselves during high school   He had more dates than me and all the girls loved him  Boy  sometimes I was jealous  Today was one of those days  I can see that he was nervous about his speech  So  I smacked5 him on the back and said  "Hey  big guy  you'll be great " He looked at me with one of those looks (the really grateful one) and smiled "Thanks " he said  As he started his speech  he cleared his throat  and began  "Graduation is a time to thank those who helped you make it through those tough years  Your parents  your teachers  your siblings6  maybe a coach     but mostly your friends  I am here to tell all of you that being a friend to someone is the best gift you can give him or her  I am going to tell you a story " I just looked at my friend with disbelief as he told the story of the first day we met  He had planned to kill himself over the weekend  He talked of how he had cleaned out his locker7 so his Mom wouldn't have to do it later and was carrying his stuff home  He looked hard at me and gave me a little smile  "Thankfully  I was saved  My friend saved me from doing the unspeakable " I heard the gasp8 go through the crowd as this handsome  popular boy told us all about his weakest moment  I saw his Mom and Dad looking at me and smiling that same grateful smile  Not until that moment did I realize it's depth  Never underestimate the power of your actions  With one small gesture you can change a person's life  For better or for worse
