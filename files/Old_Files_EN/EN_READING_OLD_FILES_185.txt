	My mother was livid  My grandmother had that self-satisfied look of someone who has thrown down an unbeatable trump12 card  "I can do what I want  Ellen  and you can't stop me " My mother glared at her mother  She glared at me  No one can glare like my mother  If there were a glaring Olympics  she would undoubtedly13 win the gold medal 
	 
	I  of course  kept shoving peas down my throat  The glares made me nervous  and every single pea made me want to throw up  but the magical image of that five dollars floated before me  and I finally gagged down every last one of them  My grandmother handed me the five dollars with a flourish  My mother continued to glare in silence  And the episode ended  Or so I thought 
	 
	My grandmother left for Aunt Lillian's a few weeks later  That night  at dinner  my mother served two of my all-time favorite foods  meatloaf and mashed14 potatoes  Along with them came a big  steaming bowl of peas  She offered me some peas  and I  in the very last moments of my innocent youth  declined  My mother fixed15 me with a cold eye as she heaped a huge pile of peas onto my plate  Then came the words that were to haunt me for years 
	 
	"You ate them for money " she said  "You can eat them for love "
	 
	Oh  despair  Oh  devastation16  Now  too late  came the dawning realization17 that I had unwittingly damned myself to a hell from which there was no escape 
	 
	"You ate them for money  You can eat them for love "
	 
	What possible argument could I muster18 against that  There was none  Did I eat the peas  You bet I did  I ate them that day and every other time they were served thereafter  The five dollars were quickly spent  My grandmother passed away a few years later  But the legacy19 of the peas lived on  as it lives on to this day  If I so much as curl my lip when they are served (because  after all  I still hate the horrid20 little things)  my mother repeats the dreaded21 words one more time: "You ate them for money " she says  "You can eat them for love "
