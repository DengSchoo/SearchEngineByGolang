Elvis lives At least he does today in the hearts of tens of thousands showing their tender love for the King on the 25th anniversary of his death Refusing to let go of fond memories fans are once again flocking to Graceland Elvis-- white- columned Memphis mansion1 This annual event is informally known as "Dead Elvis Week" an almost religious pilgrimage that marks the anniversary of Elvis' death on August 16 1977  Feeling like a cross between an Easter vigil and Mardi Gras the week of mourning is hardly a somber2 affair In fact it includes all kinds of parties concerts and memorials The highlight however is a candlelight vigil involving more than 10 000 fans from all over the world In twos and threes they walk up to the small poolside garden where Elvis is buried The King of Rock 'n' Roll' may be dead but for these devotees he is never truly gone  Elvis Aaron Presley wasn't born a king In fact he grew up dirt-poor in rural Tennessee Legend has it that Elvis was working as a truck driver in Memphis when he made his first recording3: a belated birthday gift for his mother Later when Sun Records owner Sam Phillips heard Elvis' soulful voice he thought he had finally found what he had been looking for--a white man who sounded black Phillips boasted that with Elvis on his label he would make a million dollars  Early Sun recordings4 had Elvis on vocals5 and guitar backed by another guitar and a stand-up bass6 He was playing the kind of material he would one day become famous for: blues7 country songs and gospel hymns8 It was a long way from the white jumpsuits and Las Vegas-style concerts everyone now associates with Elvis But those early recordings helped define the kind of music that the world now knows as Rock 'n' Roll d" old age in America  with satisfying final years and a dignified9 death  Unfortunately   none too good  For many elderly Americans old age is a tragedy  a period of quiet despair  deprivation10   desolation and muted rage  This can be a consequence of the kind of life a person has led in younger years and the problems in his or her relationships with others  There are also inevitable11 personal and physical losses to be sustained  some of which can become overwhelming and unbearable12  All of this is the individual factor  the existential element  But old age is frequently a tragedy even when the early years have been fulfilling and people seemingly have everything going for them  Herein lies what I consider to be the genuine tragedy of old age in America -- we have shaped a society which is extremely harsh to live in when one is old  The tragedy of old age is not the fact that each of us must grow old and die but that the process of doing so has been made unnecessarily and at times excruciatingly painful  humiliating  debilitating13 and isolating14 through insensitivity  ignorance and poverty  The potentials for satisfactions and even triumphs in late life are real and vastly under explored  For the most part the elderly struggle to exist in an inhospitable world
