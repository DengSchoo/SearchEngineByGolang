True love is we stick together in thick and thin Especially when its thin when its troublesome Then we should really bridge over the troubled water Thats what they say in English But most of us fail the test to ourselves not to our partners He might leave you he might stay with you because youre nice or not nice But you fail yourself You leave yourself You leave the most noble being that you really are So we should check up on this to our family members or whomever that is beloved and dear to us Most of the time in critical situations we just turn our backs and that is no good Of course we have our anger our frustrations1 because our partners are not as loving as usual or whomever that is; but he or she is in a different situation At that time she or he is in mental suffering Its just as bad or even worse than physical suffering Physical suffering you can take a pill or you can have an injection and it stops or at least temporarily stops and you feel the effect right away; or at least if people are in physical suffering everyone sympathizes with them But when they are in mental anguish2 and we pound them more on that and we turn our backs and become cold and indifferent that is even more cruel even worse That person will be swimming alone in suffering And especially they trust us as the next of kin3 the next person the one that they think they can rely on in times of need; and then at that time we just turn around and are snobbish4 because they didnt treat us nice so we just want to revenge Thats not the time You can revenge later when hes in better shape Just slap him Actually at that time the person is not his usual self anymore He was probably under very great pressure that he lost his own control Its not really lost his own control but for example when you are in a hurry your talk is different Right Hand me that coat Quick Quick Quick Things like that But normally you would say Honey please can you give me that coat Is that not so Audience: Yes Or when youre in pain for example stomach pain heartache or whatever you scream loudly; and anyone who comes to talk to you you dont talk in the usual way anymore because youre in pain Similarly when you are in a mental or psychological pain you talk also in a very grouchy5 way very cross But that is understandable So if we any socalled loving partner or family member do not understand even this very least very basic concept then were finished Then we are really in a bad situation Its not that the partner will do anything to us Whether he does anything to us later or not that is no problem The problem is us The problem is we degrade ourselves that we make less of a being of ourselves than we should be than we are supposed to be or that we really are So do not make less of a being of yourselves  really are So do not make less of a being of yourselves I began taking lessons I wanted to be the best I could be and I swelled8 with pride every time I got on Sequoia It truly was a dream come true I learned to brush him saddle him pick his hooves out Each week I could not wait for Saturday and my lesson then my free time with my Sequoia When I was in Sequoia's presence I forgot all about my problems and felt strong and secure 	 	As I see it horses are silent too but they are fast powerful and free at the same time Horses give me the strength I lack They give me a reason to push myself when I can find no other Horses have been part of my life for well over twenty years now all the while helping9 me deal with an isolating10 frightening disorder When things get difficult as they still sometimes do I go to my horses With them I can be silent but I can hold my head up and have dignity and freedom By connecting with them I have learned to embrace what I was once shunned11 for and I found my voice 	 	I am a fully4 participating member of society these days My horses and I made it through a master's degree and then law school I am a practicing attorney I even make court appearances I may have made it otherwise but I'm not sure I feel I owe my life to the horse and I try to give it back to them every day I am fortunate that I can look out my back door and see my beautiful horses looking back at me I am so grateful that I get to watch them run in their mountain pasture every day I hope I never stop learning from them They have given me the best gift I could ever imagine my life
