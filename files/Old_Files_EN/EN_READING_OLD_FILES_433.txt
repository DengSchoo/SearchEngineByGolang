One has the leisure of July for perceiving all the differences of the green of leaves It is no longer a difference in degrees of maturity1 for all the trees have darkened to their final tone and stand in their differences of character and not of mere2 date Almost all the green is grave not sad and not dull It has a darkened and a daily color in majestic3 but not obvious harmony with dark grey skies and might look to inconstant eyes as prosaic4 after spring as eleven o'clock looks after the dawn  Gravity is the world--not solemnity as towards evening nor menace as at night The daylight trees of July are signs of common beauty common freshness and a mystery familiar and abiding5 as night and day In childhood we all have a more exalted6 sense of dawn and summer sunrise than we ever fully7 retain or quite recover; and also a far higher sensibility for April and April evenings--a heartache for them which in riper years is gradually and irretrievably consoled  But on the other hand childhood has so quickly learned to find daily things tedious and familiar things importunate that it has no great delight in the mere middle of the day and feels weariness of the summer that has ceased to change visibly  The poetry of mere day and of late summer becomes perceptive8 to mature eyes that have long ceased to be sated have taken leave of weariness and cannot now find anything in nature too familiar; eyes which have indeed lost sight of the further awe9 of midsummer day break and no longer see so much of the past in April twilight10 as they saw when they had no past; but which look freshly at the dailiness of green summer of early afternoon of every sky of any form that comes to pass and of the darkened elms n your mind see yourself achieving them in all of their sensory4 details  Mentally live the experience see the sights hear the sounds smell the aroma5 feel the feelings Your nurtured6 beliefs will lead you to their reality
