"You look tired " "This makes me irate1 (And I never say that word ) This is never okay No one ever wants to hear that especially a girl We already have enough problems trying to keep things sucked and tucked2 in all day let alone you telling us we look like we didn't sleep well Yeah yeah I am tired I'm busy walking my dogs writing a book touring the country putting on acrobatic lingerie and posing3 for you all while you make yogurt commercials " -Jessimae Peluso "Have you lost weight " "When a guy says this or 'Wow you look slimmer ' my blood starts to boil because nope I'm the exact same weight I was yesterday I resist the urge to grab4 a marker pants this doofus circle all his fat and instead say 'I haven't lost any weight But you've lost any chance of going home with me ' The only way this dude can recover is by full-on admitting he was just trying to be nice and didn't know what else to say because I'm always looking great But seriously don't comment on a woman's weight ever " -Marianne Schaberg writer and comedian5 "Wow I didn't recognize you with makeup6 on " "It drives me nuts when I wear makeup and a man says to me 'Oh my god I didn't recognize you You're so pretty ' This is the ultimate backhanded compliment7 I don't wear make-up at my day job because I don't consider all of life a show A simple 'You look very pretty today ' is fine Beyond that we're not that close so please keep your comments to yourself I don't tell you when your bald spot looks extra shiny don't tell me when I'm looking tired or fat or thin I have a mirror Believe me I know " -Corinne Fisher comedian New York City "Can't you take a joke " "Sometimes when men find out I perform stand-up comedy they think that gives them permission to 'fake-insult' me When I don't laugh they ask 'Can't you take a joke ' to which I say 'Can't you tell a joke ' Enjoying humor isn't a green light for reciting every sexist joke your uncle told the family at Thanksgiving dinner " -Carolyn Busa host of "Side Ponytail" in Williamsburg Brooklyn  But I noticed that Grandpa left plenty of room for the brief highlights  Not every nook of his garden was constantly in bloom  There was always a treasured surprise tucked somewhere  I came to see  too  that Grandpa's garden mirrored his life  He was a hard worker who understood the law of the harvest  But along with his hard work  Grandpa knew how to enjoy each season  each change  We often teased him about his life history  He had written two paragraphs summarizing fifty years of work  and a full nine pages about every trip and vacation he'd ever taken  In July  Grandpa worsened  One hot afternoon arrived when no one else was at his bedside  He was glad to have me there  and reached out his hand to pull me close  I told Grandpa what I had learned -- that few flowers last from April to November  Some of the most beautiful bloom for only a month at most  To really enjoy a garden  you have to plant corners and drifts and rows of flowers that will bloom and grace the garden  each in its own season  His eyes listened to every word  Then  another discovery: "If I want a garden like yours  Grandpa  I'm going to have to work " His grin laughed at me  and his eyes teased me  "Grandpa  in your life right now the chrysanthemums5 are in bloom  Chrysanthemums and roses " Tears clouded both our eyes  Neither of us feared this last flower of fall  but the wait for spring seems longest in November  We knew how much we would miss each other  Sitting there  I suddenly felt that the best gift I could give Grandpa would be to give voice to the testimony6 inside both of us  He had never spoken of his testimony to me  but it was such a part of his life that I had never questioned if Grandpa knew  I knew he knew  "Grandpa " I began -- and his grip tightened7 as if he knew what I was going to say -- "I want you to know that I have a testimony  I know the Savior lives  I bear witness to you that Joseph Smith is a prophet  I love the Restoration and joy in it " The steadiness in Grandpa's eyes told how much he felt it too  "I bear witness that President Kimball is a prophet  I know the Book of Mormon is true  Grandpa  Every part of me bears this witness " "Grandpa " I added quietly  "I know our Father in Heaven loves you " Unbidden  unexpected  the Spirit bore comforting  poignant8 testimony to me of our Father's love for my humble  quiet Grandpa  A tangible9 sense of Heavenly Father's compassionate10 awareness of Grandpa's suffering surrounded us and held us  It was so personal and powerful that no words were left to me -- only tears of gratitude11 and humility12  tears of comfort  Grandpa and I wept together  It was the end of August when Grandpa died  the end of summer  As we were choosing flowers from the florist13 for Grandpa's funeral  I slipped away to Grandpa's garden and walked with my memories of columbine and Sweet William  Only the tall lavender and white phlox were in bloom now  and some baby's breath in another corner  On impulse  I cut the prettiest strands14 of phlox and baby's breath and made one more arrangement for the funeral  When they saw it  friends and family all smiled to see Grandpa's flowers there  We all felt how much Grandpa would have liked that  The October after Grandpa's death  I planted tulip and daffodil bulbs  snowdrops  crocuses  and bluebells15  Each bulb was a comfort to me  a love sent to Grandpa  a promise of spring
