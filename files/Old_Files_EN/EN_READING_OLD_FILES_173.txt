Which is correct: A dozen eggs is Or A dozen eggs are I remember being in elementary school and my teachers making a big deal about the unit And I never really got that until one day I was in the grocery store and I wanted to buy an apple but I couldnt buy one apple I had to buy a whole bag of apples So I did I bought one bag of apples I took it home I took one apple out of the bag and I cut it up And then I ate one slice One bag one apple one slice Which of these is the real one Well they all are of course and thats what my elementary teachers were trying to tell me Because this is the important idea behind whole number place value decimal1 place value and fractions Our whole number system depends on being able to change what we count as one Our whole number system depends on being able to change units There are two ways to change units We can compose and we can partition2 When we compose units we take a bunch of things we put them together to make a bigger thing like a dozen eggs We take 12 eggs put them together to make a group and we call that group a dozen A dozen eggs is a composed unit Other examples of composed units include a deck of cards a pair of shoes a jazz quartet and of course Barbie and Ken3 make a couple But think about a loaf of bread Thats not a composed unit because we dont get a bunch of slices from a bunch of different bakeries and put them together to make a loaf No we start with a loaf of bread and we cut it into smaller pieces called slices so each slice of bread is a partitioned4 unit Other examples of partitioned units include a square of a chocolate bar a section of an orange and a slice of pizza The important thing about units is that once weve made a new unit we can treat it just like we did the old unit We can compose composed units and we can partition partitioned units Think about toaster pastries5 They come in packs of two and then those packs get put together in sets of four to make a box So when I buy one box of toaster pastries am I buying one thing four things or eight things It depends on the unit One box four packs eight pastries And when I share a slice of pizza with a friend we have to cut it into two smaller pieces So a box of toaster pastries is composed of composed units and when I split6 a slice of pizza Im partitioning7 a partitioned unit But what does that have to do with math In math everything is certain Two plus two equals four and one is just one But thats not really right One isnt always one Heres why: we start counting at one and we count up to nine: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and then we get to 10 and in order to write 10 we write a one and a zero That one means that we have one group and the zero helps us remember that it means one group not one thing But 10 just like one just like a dozen eggs just like an egg 10 is a unit And 10 tens make 100 So when I think about 100 its like the box of toaster pastries Is 100 one thing 10 things or 100 things And that depends on what one is it depends on what the unit is So think about all the times in math when you write the number one No matter what place that one is in no matter how many things that one represents one is at one is in no matter how many things that one represents one is e  while single women are less likely to take sick days and visited the doctor less frequently than married women  Being single can even help your chances of keeping off weight after surgery: One study found that unmarried men and women were 2 7 times more likely to keep to diet and exercise goals after weight loss surgery  	 	11  ALONE TIME IS GOOD FOR YOU  	 	Being alone doesn't necessarily mean being lonely  Spending time on your own gives you time to clear your mind  identify your own goals and priorities  and participate in activities that interest you  Research has even found that a bit of alone time can help us become more empathetic  foster creativity  and even improve our relationships d as the very first Christmas
