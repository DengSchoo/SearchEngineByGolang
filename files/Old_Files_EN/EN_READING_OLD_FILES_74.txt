It takes all sorts to make a world so some say Nobody is the same and our different personalities1 and character traits make us what we are Wouldnt it be boring if we were all the same But if someone doesnt behave or think like you it can be frustrating2 And theres one personality type that can be very difficult to deal with narcissism3 Narcissists consider themselves the most important person Theyre only interested in their own life without a care in the world about the people around them Their lack of empathy makes them come across as arrogant4 and selfimportant If you know someone like this their narcissistic5 attitudes might irritate you But you might find it even more irritating to know that according to new research they are likely to be happier than other people An ongoing6 study of narcissism by researchers at Queens University Belfast has found such people might infuriate others but are less likely to be stressed or depressed7 Writing about the research the BBCs Sean Coughlan says They might have trampled8 over others and left a trail of emotional damage around them but narcissists also seem to be insulated against feeling bad about themselves And their heightened sense of selfimportance appears to give them protective qualities Researchers have been trying to understand why narcissism appears to be more prevalent in areas such as politics social media and celebrity9 culture and why narcissists shameless overconfident attitude seems to be rewarded rather than penalised It does seem that they have the best of all worlds which is not great news for shrinking violets And theres more bad news for those who are shy and retiring: previous research by Queens University has also found that a mental toughness helps narcissists succeed at work and in their social lives because they can overcome rejection10 and disappointment And other tests have found that narcissistic students do better in exams not because they are more clever but because of their confidence and assertiveness11 But psychologist Dr Kostas Papageorgiou from the research team argues that these personality traits should not be seen as either good or bad but as products of evolution and expressions of human nature So at the end of the day we are what we are and thats just something we cant change e and that's just something we can't change e orget the power of relaxation5  You don't always have to force yourself to study if you are tired  You can also listen to some music  watch a movie or listen to an audio book (in English of course)  It doesn't sound too difficult does it
