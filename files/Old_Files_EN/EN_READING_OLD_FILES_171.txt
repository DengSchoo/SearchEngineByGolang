I choose the thoughts that make me feel comfortable with growing older I am the perfect age Each year is special and precious and filled with wonders all its own Being elderly is as special as being a child Yet my culture fears old age so much Weve made it such a terrible terrible thing to get old And yet its normal and natural Weve created a youthworship culture that is harmful to us all I look forward to growing older The alternative is to leave the planet1 I choose to love myself at every age Just because I am older it does not mean I have to get sick and infirm I do not have to be hooked2 up to machines or suffer in nursing homes in order to leave the planet When its my time to go Ill do it gentlyperhaps go to bed take a nap3 and leave peacefully  a nap3 and leave peacefully 	-----ing It's just as bad or even worse than physical suffering Physical suffering you can take a pill or you can have an injection and it stops or at least temporarily stops and you feel the effect right away; or at least if people are in physical suffering everyone sympathizes with them 	 	But when they are in mental anguish2 and we pound them more on that and we turn our backs and become cold and indifferent that is even more cruel even worse That person will be swimming alone in suffering And especially they trust us as the next of kin3 the next person the one that they think they can rely on in times of need; and then at that time we just turn around and are snobbish4 because they didn't treat us nice so we just want to revenge That's not the time You can revenge later when he's in better shape Just slap him 	 	Actually at that time the person is not his usual self anymore He was probably under very great pressure that he lost his own control It's not really lost his own control but for example when you are in a hurry your talk is different Right "Hand me that coat Quick Quick Quick " Things like that But normally you would say "Honey please can you give me that coat " Is that not so (Audience: Yes ) Or when you're in pain -- for example stomach pain heartache or whatever -- you scream loudly; and anyone who comes to talk to you you don't talk in the usual way anymore because you're in pain 	 	Similarly when you are in a mental or psychological pain you talk also in a very grouchy5 way very cross But that is understandable So if we -- any so-called loving partner or family member -- do not understand even this very least very basic concept then we're finished Then we are really in a bad situation It's not that the partner will do anything to us Whether he does anything to us later or not that is no problem The problem is us The problem is we degrade ourselves that we make less of a being of ourselves than we should be than we are supposed to be or that we really are So do not make less of a being of yourselves  you together
