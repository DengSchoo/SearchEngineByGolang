What would you say when you are under work pressure "stressed out and frantic1" or "challenged and energized" There is very little physiological2 difference between the two says a growing contingent3 of experts who claim works stress has an upside These experts believe that stress can strengthen you or tear you down In most cases you can choose  Give stress a good name why recent work stress -- it's an indicator4 that your career is advancing Think of a heavy work load as an exciting opportunity to push yourself learn new skills and show your mettle5 Complaining depletes6 your energy; instead greet an overloaded7 day with optimism Tell yourself "This is a challenge i am capable of handling " Put it in perspective sometimes it's impossible to talk about the positive side of stress -- say your computer crashes and you lose valuable work -- but you can moderate your reaction Rate your distress8 on a scale of 1 to 10 1 being mild irratation and 10 extreme panic or anger Now rank the importance of the situation from 1 ( a notice ) to 10 ( you're fired ) If your distress ranks higher than the seriousness of the situation ask yourself: Is this something i will remember in four years four months four days Then downshift your response accordingly saving your emotinal energy for disasters ursuing it  This is only true if you pursue it unwisely  Gamblers at Monte Carlo are pursuing money  and most of them lose it instead  but there are other ways of pursuing money  which often succeed  So it is with happiness  If you pursue it by means of drink  you are forgetting the hang-over  Epicurus pursued it by living only in congenial society and eating only dry bread  supplemented by a little cheese on feast days  His method proved successful in his case  but he was a valetudinarian  and most people would need something more vigorous  For most people  the pursuit of happiness  unless supplemented in various ways  is too abstract and theoretical to be adequate as a personal rule of life  But I think that whatever personal rule of life you may choose it should not  except in rare and heroic cases  be incompatible with happiness  Man is an animal  and his happiness depends on his physiology more than he likes to think  This is a humble conclusion  but I cannot make myself disbelieve it  Unhappy businessmen  I am convinced  would increase their happiness more by walking six miles every day than by any conceivable change of philosophy
