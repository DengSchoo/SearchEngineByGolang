Consider YOU  In all of the time before now and in all of the time to come  there has never been and will never be anyone just like you  You are unique in the entire history and future of the universe  Wow Stop and think about that  You're better than one in a million  or a billion or a gazillion Y ou are the only one in a sea of infinity1  You're amazing  You're awesome2  And by the way TAG you're it  As amazing and awesome as you already are  you can be even more so  Beautiful young people are the whimsey of nature  but beautiful old people are true works of art  But you don't become "beautiful" just by virtue3 of the aging process  Real beauty comes from learning growing and loving in the ways of life  That is the Art of Life  You can learn slowly and sometimes painfully by just waiting for life to happen to you  Or you can choose to accelerate your growth and intentionally4 devour5 life and all it offers  You are the artist that paints your future with the brush of today  Paint a Masterpiece  God gives every bird its food but he doesn't throw it into its nest  Wherever you want to go whatever you want to do it's truly up to you ou tion and foreign revolutions alike without fear  Since the beginning of our American history we have been engaged in change  in a perpetual  peaceful revolution  a revolution which goes on steadily5  quietly  adjusting itself to changing conditions without the concentration camp or the quicklime in the ditch  The world order which we seek is the cooperation of free countries  working together in a friendly  civilized6 society  This nation has placed its destiny in the hands  heads and hearts of its millions of free men and women  and its faith in freedom under the guidance of God  Freedom means the supremacy7 of human rights everywhere  Our support goes to those who struggle to gain those rights and keep them  Our strength is our unity8 of purpose  To that high concept there can be no end save victory
