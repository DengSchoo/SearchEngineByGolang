For many of us theres nothing better than burying our head in a good book Whether its a gripping crime story or a biography of someones amazing life its good to read a book to switch off from the distractions1 of everyday life and help us relax Maybe thats why some of them are actually being prescribed as a remedy to sickness It may seem obvious that reading is good for us It can be educational and as some say it can broaden the mind A good novel can make us happy or sad or make us cry as we empathise with characters The power of books was recognised a few years ago by the British charity Reading Agency who published a list of books that doctors could offer to patients tackling topics from depression to dementia to chronic2 pain It called this bibliotherapy and its become so successful that its about to be extended to children as well Professor Philip Davis studies the effects of literature at Liverpool University and is author of a book called Reading for Life He studies people in reading groups and found that its reading literature written work thought to have artistic3 merit that has the best effect He told the BBC that when reading something for pleasure the brain begins to work from different parts from a different hemisphere and it gets excited it gets preemotional and you can see the brain coming to life Of course its easy in our smartphone generation to ditch a good book and fiddle4 with our phones instead But opening up a paperback5 could be a simple way to help boost or maintain our mental health Its thought they can help you set targets and find focus And they may allow you to see that awkward situation youve been anxious about for weeks from someone elses perspective If youre not an avid6 reader it can be hard to know where to begin If the Reading Agency book list doesnt appeal you could to read book reviews visit a library or bookshop or ask a friend Once youve found the right text youll be hooked And if you still love your technology you could always use an ereader nology you could always use an e-reader r f speaking to someone new might make you anxious But the American research found "both extroverts8 and introverts9 are happier when they are asked to behave in an extroverted10 manner " So maybe if you're a loner it's time to come out of your shell and make some small talk with a stranger  it could be the beginning of a new friendship  so much from Kai		 	about how to truly live all the days we are given here 		 	Lessons on kindness  generosity7   hope  and good cheer seemed to flow freely from her daily life 		 	I think most of all she taught me that joy like love is quite contagious8		 	and that I should always strive to be a carrier of them both 		 	May the same be said for all of us 		 	Thanks Kai
