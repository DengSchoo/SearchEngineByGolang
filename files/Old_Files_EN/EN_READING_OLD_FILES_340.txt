There are three kinds of goals: short-term medium-term and long-term goals  Short-term goals are those that usually deal with current activities which we can apply on a daily basis Such goals can be achieved in a week or less or two weeks or possibly months It should be remembered that just as a building is no stronger than its foundation our short-term goals cannot amount to very much without the achievement of solid short-term goals Upon completing our short-term goals we should date the occasion and then add new short-term goals that will build on the foundation of the short-term goals They might deal with just one term of school or the entire school year or they could even extend for several years Any time you move a step at a time you should never allow yourself to become discouraged or overwhelmed As you complete each step you will enforce the belief in your ability to grow and succeed And as your list of completion dates grow your motivation and desire will increase  Long-term goals may be related to our dreams of the future They might cover five years or more Life is not a static thing We should never allow a long-term goal to limit us or our course of action you see the author's journey There are loads of great quotes which you are likely to read many times over for daily inspiration and affirmation  that needed to be performed  before the show could go on inute  I want to show you something " "Of course " she answered  "what do you want me to see " Pointing to a spot on her dress  she said  "Right here is where my mommy kissed my dress  and here " pointing to another spot  "and here is another kiss   and here  and here Mommy said that she put all those kisses on my dress so that I would have her kisses for every booboo'that made me cry " Then the lady realized that she wasn't just looking at a dress  no  she was looking at a mother…who knew that she was going away and would not be there to kiss away the hurts that she knew her daughter would get  So she took all the love she had for her beautiful little girl and put them into this dress  that her child now so proudly wore  She no longer saw a little girl in a simple dress  She saw a child wrapped…in her mother's love jected  "What do you mean  Aren't we going to The Matinee  Mommy  you said that we are going to the Matinee  " Mother stooped9 and gathered us in her arms  I couldn't understand why there were tears in her eyes  We still had the time to get the bus  but hugging us  she gently explained this is a fib felt like  "It is important that what we say is true  " Mom said  "I fibbed to you just now and it felt awful to me  I don't ever want to fib again and I'm sure you don't want to fib again either  People must be able to believe each others  Do you understand  " We assured10 her that we understood  We would never forget  And since we had learned a lesson  why not go to the movie to see The Matinee  There were still time  Not today  Mother told us  We would go another time  That is how over fifty years ago  my sister and I learned to be truthful  We have never forgotten how much a fib can be hurt
