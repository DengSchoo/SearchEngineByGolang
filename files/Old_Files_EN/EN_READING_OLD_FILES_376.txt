They say Life and Death are not in anyone's hands  They are things that just happen every time and with everyone Same is the case with time Most of the times we take it for granted that there is always plenty of time Due to this perhaps we indulge in various activities which are a wholesale1 waste of time  The clock is always ticking The seconds keep on ticking just like busy ants The ants keep themselves always busy by always hunting for food everywhere Similarly the seconds always keep on ticking to attain2 short-term goals of making a minute with 60 ticks After reaching a milestone3 of a minute the second's hand of a clock don't take a break but start afresh for another round of 60 ticks The take it minute by minute and inadvertently reach a quarter of an hour and hour and then a day They always focus on the smaller targets-that is a minute and the bigger aim of the clock itself gets fulfilled That's why the minutes hand have to work less as the seconds hand does most of the running around The minute hand just has to make 60 movements on a clock dial The hours hand is the luckiest of the lot It just moves for 12 times in an hour But the seconds hand movies for 3600 times around the dial for the same hour  Parallel to this in our life to we never realizes that we have lots to do Between every big task we can always find enough time to fit in a plethora4 of smaller tasks If you are waiting for a train at the station you can always read a magazine or rather chalk out your study timetable for exams While traveling in the bus too one can find enough time to at least skim through the previous days notes  Be like the clock Always keep on ticking by involving yourself in various things and learning new things These small knowledge and experience modules5 will perhaps one day take you to your bigger goal some day They say "Time and Tide waits for no man" If so now stop staring at the screen and utilize6 your time effectively robably nothing " Kelly sighed  "What are you doing " She pointed to Valeri  "Oh " Valeri put her book down  "I don't know  Maybe nothing " The week flew by  Before I knew it  I was sitting in the auditorium10  listening to a group of girls sing the latest pop songs at the talent show  I was bored out of my life  and I wanted it to end so I could read Eragon  I'd checked it out at the library  Then a shy girl walked on stage  I recongized her immediately  Valeri clutched a violin in one hand and a bow in the other  She stared to play  The notes formed a soft  weet tune11  Then it turned fast  then faster  The music stopped altogether before the tune retumed  Valeri ended the song with one hard  fast  loud note  The auditorium fell completely silent until we realized the music was finished  Still in a halftrance  we burst into applause  Valeri took a swift bow and walked off stage  I smiled to myself  Valeri wasn't just a "quiet girl" She knew about wonderful books and could play the violin like nothing I'd ever heard  Like a caterpillar1 or butterfly  she was beautiful and amazing when you looked closely
