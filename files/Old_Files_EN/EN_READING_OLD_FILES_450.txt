That if your vocabulary is limited your chances of success are limited  That one of the easiest and quickest ways to get ahead is by consciously building up your knowledge of words  The the vocabulary of the average person almost stops growing by the middle twenties And that from then on it is necessary to have an intelligent plan if progress is to be made No haphazard1 hit-or-miss methods will do  The study of words is not merely something that has to do with literature Words are your tools of thought You can't even think at all without them Try it If you are planning to go downtown thin afternoon you will find that you are saying to yourself "I think i will go downtown this afternoon " You can't make such a simple decision as this without using words  Without words you could make no decisions and from no judgements whatsoever2 A pianist may have the most beautiful tunes3 in his head but if he had only five keys on his piano he would never get more than a fraction4 of these tunes out  The study of words is not only to improve the processes of your mind It will give you assurance5; build your self-confidence; lend color to your personality; increase your popularity6 Your words are your personality Your vocabulary is you And your words are all that we your friends have to know and judge you by You have no other medium for telling us your thoughts-for convincing us persuading us giving us orders
