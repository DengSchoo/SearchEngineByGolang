After spending nearly every waking minute with Angel for eight straight days I knew that I had to tell her just one thing So late at night just before she fell asleep I whispered it in her ear She smiled the kind of smile that makes me smile back and she said When Im seventyfive and I think about my life and what it was like to be young I hope that I can remember this very moment A few seconds later she closed her eyes and fell asleep The room was peaceful almost silent All I could hear was the soft purr of her breathing I stayed awake thinking about the time wed spent together and all the choices in our lives that made this moment possible And at some point I realized that it didnt matter what wed done or where wed gone Nor did the future hold any significance All that mattered was the serenity1 of the moment Just being with her and breathing with her The moral2: We must not allow the clock the calendar and external3 pressures to rule our lives and blind us to the fact that each individual moment of our lives is a beautiful mystery and a miracle4 especially those moments we spend in the presence5 of a loved one resence5 of a loved one one s for making the most of life Sadly she was not able to achieve all of her 50 things before she died at the age of 45 	 	Creating a bucket list can certainly give us hope but some people have argued it can be used as a coping3 strategy4 to try to control something uncontrollable - death Clinical psychologist Linda Blair told the BBC that she was "not really in favour of bucket lists [they] take you away from the chance to be spontaneous5 " It's probably true that a list can encourage people to follow someone else's idea of the perfect life And also following a fixed6 list of goals makes you less impulsive7 - your aims and wishes might change as you approach the day when you finally kick the bucket 	 	But why not at least dream of what we would like to do Why not reach for the stars even if we only reach the sky Whether we want to plan it or just see what happens we don't know what tomorrow will bring so maybe we should live for today
