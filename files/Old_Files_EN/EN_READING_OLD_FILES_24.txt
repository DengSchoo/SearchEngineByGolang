Kenneth BranaghI think its a quote from Shakespeare from A Midsummer Nights Dream which is four words take pains be perfect I think its his way of saying dont be afraid of caring Dont be afraid of your passion Like just give it free reign1 and be honest and work hard and it will all turn out just fine 16I live near a couple of parks in London One night I couldnt sleep It was summer I got up really early in the morning I went and walked to the nearest big hill and I saw the sun rising over London which is one of the greatest cities in the world Sometimes thats the answer Just get up when the sun gets up and look around and you realize youre part of an amazing planet2 So Im not wasting any time And the thing is with negativity for my money they are just they are like clouds that pass across the sun You know they will pass Theyre just feelings Its important not to dwell3 on them  feelings It's important not to dwell3 on them 	 was developed in the 1970s The first reference to the term cited by the Oxford6 English Dictionary comes in 1975 in the work of US psychologist Raymond Novaco 	 	Today's courses are based on cognitive7 behaviour therapy says Isabel Clarke who has been running them for the UK's National Health Service in Southampton She says: "What convinced me is seeing people change For people who use anger and bullying8 to change that is a big ask "	 	It doesn't work for everyone About 30% of people dropped out But for those who persevered9 it led them to change their behaviour says Clarke 	 	Among the recommendations for people with a short fuse are: accept that different opinions are acceptable listen to the other person and don't take anything personally 	 	Control used to be seen as repression10 But these days letting it all out ranting11 and raving12 is viewed as destructive behaviour says Antonia Macaro the Financial Times' agony aunt 	 	Maybe the best thing is just count to ten when you feel you are about to hit the roof It might not give you time to calm down but will allow the other person to run away instein thought it was vital to leave some room for older works  too. Otherwise  you'd be completely dependent on the prejudices and fashions of [your] times  he wrote in a 1952 journal article.
