Time is running out for my friend While we are sitting at lunch she casually1 mentions that she and her husband are thinking of starting a family What she means is that her biological clock has begun its countdown and she is being forced to consider the prospect2 of motherhood Were taking a survey she says half joking Do you think I should have a baby It will change your life I say carefully keeping my tone neutral I know she says No more sleeping in on Saturdays no more spontaneous vacations  But that is not what I mean at all I try to decide what to tell her I want her to know what she will never learn in childbirth classes: that the physical wounds of childbearing heal but that becoming a mother will leave an emotional wound so raw that she will be forever vulnerable I consider warning her that she will never read a newspaper again without asking What if that had been my child That every plane crash every fire will haunt her That when she sees pictures of starving children she will wonder if anything could be worse than watching your child die I look at her manicured nails and stylish3 suit and think that no matter how sophisticated she is becoming a mother will reduce her to the primitive4 level of a bear protecting her cub5 That an urgent call of Mommy will cause her to drop her best crystal without a moments hesitation6 I feel I should warn her that no matter how many years she has invested in her career she will be professionally derailed by motherhood She might arrange for childcare but one day she will be going into an important business meeting and she will think about her babys sweet smell She will have to use every ounce of discipline to keep from running home just to make sure her child is all right I want my friend to know that everyday decisions will no longer be routine That a 5yearold boys desire to go to the mens room rather than the womens at a restaurant will become a major dilemma7 That issues of independence and gender8 identity will be weighed against the prospect that a child molester9 may be lurking10 in the rest room However decisive she may be at the office she will secondguess herself constantly as a mother Looking at my attractive friend I want to assure her that eventually she will shed the pounds of pregnancy11 but she will never feel the same about herself That her life now so important will be of less value to her once she has a child That she would give it up in a moment to save her offspring but will also begin to hope for more years not to accomplish her own dreams but to watch her child accomplish his My friends relationship with her husband will change but not in the way she thinks I wish she could understand how much more you can love a man who is always careful to powder the baby or who never hesitates to play with his son or daughter I think she should know that she will fall in love with her husband again for reasons she now finds very unromantic I want to describe to my friend the exhilaration of seeing your child learn to hit a baseball I want to capture for her the belly12 laugh of a baby who is touching13 the soft fur of a dog for the first time I want her to taste the joy that is so real it hurts My friends quizzical look makes me realize that tears have formed in my eyes Youll never regret it I say finally Then squeezing my friends hand I offer a prayer for her and for me and all the mere14 mortal women who stumble their way into this holiest of callings e and all the mere14 mortal women who stumble their way into this holiest of callings  ppiness we're here to dash your dreams A prominent study shows that making happiness a personal goal will actually stand in the way of your achieving it The researchers found that women who valued happiness more reported being less happy and more depressed16 than women who didn't place much importance on the goal 	 	"Wanting to be happy can make you less happy " said study researcher Iris17 Mauss "If you explicitly18 and purposely focus on happiness that appears to have a self-defeating quality "	 	So if you really want to be happy try forgetting about it
