It's not easy loving yourself unconditionally1 because we've learned to judge ourselves  We seem to be driven to find what we perceive as "the missing piece" in our lives as if we are flawed or not good enough Somehow enough never seems like enough and we live our lives in a constant and never ending search which leaves us exhausted2  What we forget are the sweet moments of being present with ourselves like we are when watching a sunset  This is Faith at Faith Radio Online-Simply to Relax Today I'm inviting3 you to take time to be present within yourself dwell in your heart space and give yourself a well deserved break from striving and struggling  Just be in the present moment and allow yourself to stop searching for more and to notice how much you already have inside  Everyday we're preoccupied4 with obligations and responsibilities under great pressures from others and from ourselves and what we truly ignore or forget are ourselves From today on let's start to love ourselves unconditionally ly  what you want to be and do  and take off your coat and make a dust in the world  The busier you are  the less harm you will be apt to get into  the sweeter will be your sleep  the brighter and happier your holidays  and the better satisfied will the world be with you ess began to take shape and my color matured along with natural flaws  You have known me since the days when you came to take me from my mother  You cannot hear me  I am static and unmoving  But  I can hear your murmurs10 and your cries of pain and sadness  Your sons and daughters ask why  There are no answers  I am very old  I have seen everything and I am none the wiser for the pain and suffering and I have witnessed since I rose from the bowels11 of the earth  I have witnessed the conflict  the death  the civilizations  and the societies that have come before you  Yet I remain mystified about this day  I feel sad yet alive with a purpose  I have come to know those who are now an integral part of the reason for my being here at this place and time  That purpose has become apparent as I stand before you on this day while your brethren gather to witness my reflections and the changes of light that mirror your soul  I am a reflection of you… I am all of you… I am your spirit   I am The Wall
