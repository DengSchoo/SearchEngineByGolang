"We are reading the first verse of the first chapter of a book whose page are infinite " I do not who wrote those words but I allways likes them as a reminder1 that the future van be anything We want to take it We can take the mysterious hazy2 future and carve out of it anything that we can imagine just as a sculptor3 carves a statue from a shapeless stone We are all in the position of the farmer If we plant a good seed we reap a godd harvest If our seed is poor and full of weeds we reap a useless crop If we plant nothing at all we harvest nothing at all I want the future to be better than the past I don't want it conaminated by the mistakes and errors with which history is filled We should all be concerned about the future because that is where we will spend the remainder of our libes The past is gone and static Nothing we can do will change it The future is before us and dynamic Eberything we do will affect it Each day brings with it new frontiers in our homes and in our business if we only recognize them We are just at the beginning of the progress in every field of human endeavor  n over his brow  No matter how much my Mother washed them  they would still smell of the sea and of fish " Frank's voice dropped a bit  "When the weather was bad he would drive me to school  He had this old truck that he used in his fishing business  That truck was older than he was  It would wheeze2 and rattle3 down the road  You could hear it coming for blocks  As he would drive toward the school I would shrink down into the seat hoping to disappear  Half the time  he would slam to a stop and the old truck would belch4 a cloud of smoke  He would pull right up in front  and it seemed like everybody would be standing5 around and watching  Then he would lean over and give me a big kiss on the cheek and tell me to be a good boy  It was so embarrassing for me  Here  I was twelve years old  and my Dad would lean over and kiss me goodbye " He paused and then went on  "I remember the day I decided6 I was too old for a goodbye kiss  When we got to the school and came to a stop  he had his usual big smile  He started to lean toward me  but I put my hand up and said  'No  Dad ' It was the first time I had ever talked to him that way  and he had this surprised look on his face  I said  'Dad  I'm too old for a goodbye kiss  I'm too old for any kind of kiss ' My Dad looked at me for the longest time  and his eyes started to tear up  I had never seen him cry  He turned and looked out the windshield  'You're right ' he said  'You are a big boy    a man  I won't kiss you anymore '" Frank got a funny look on his face  and the tears began to well up in his eyes  as he spoke7  "It wasn't long after that when my Dad went to sea and never came back  It was a day when most of the fleet stayed in  but not Dad  He had a big family to feed  They found his boat adrift with its nets half in and half out  He must have gotten into a gale8 and was trying to save the nets and the floats " I looked at Frank and saw that tears were running down his cheeks  Frank spoke again  "Guys  you don't know what I would give to have my Dad give me just one more kiss on the cheek    to feel his rough old face    to smell the ocean on him    to feel his arm around my neck  I wish I had been a man then  If I had been a man  I would never have told my Dad I was too old for a goodbye kiss "
