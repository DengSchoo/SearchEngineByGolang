	They shuddered1 with cold and ran down the road to the bridge There warm they started walking hand in hand 	 	A flush came into the sky The waned2 moon halfway3 down the west sank into insignificance4 On the shadowy land things began to take life and plants with great leaves became clear They came to the beach The long wastes of shore lay moaning under the dawn and the sea; the ocean was a flat dark strip with a white edge Over the gloomy sea the sky was red Quickly the fire spread among the clouds and scattered5 them Crimson6 burned to orange orange to dull gold and in the golden glitter the sun rose The sea became glistening7 as if someone had gone along with a bucket and the light had spilled from it as she walked 	 	The breakers ran down the shore in long hoarse8 strokes Tiny seagulls like little spray wheeled above the line of surf Their crying seemed larger than their bodies Far away the coast reached melt into the morning The tussocky sand hills seemed to sink to a level with the beach On this shore only they watched the sea and the rising sun and heard the faint water and the sharp crying of the gulls9 	 		 		 	er school I found him running all alone I asked him how he felt "Okay " he said He had two more miles to go The sweat7 ran down his face and his eyes were glassy from his fever Yet he looked straight ahead and kept running We never told him he couldn't run four miles with a 103-degree fever So he didn't know 	 	Two weeks later the names of the team runners were called Joey was number six on the list Joey had made the team He was in seventh grade - the other six team members were all eighth-graders We never told him he shouldn't expect to make the team We never told him he couldn't do it We never told him he couldn't do it  so he didn't know He just did it idence that helps me down an unfamiliar4 staircase alone  That is part of it  But I mean something bigger than that: an assurance that I am  despite imperfections  a real  positive person that somewhere in the sweeping5  intricate pattern of people there is a special place where I can make myself fit

	It took me years to discover and strengthen this assurance  It had to start with the most elementary things  Onc e a man gave me an indoor baseball  I thought he was mocking me and I was hurt   "I can' t use this " I said  "Take it with you " he urged me " and roll it around  "The words stuck in my head " Roll it around " By rolling the ball I could hear where it went  This gave me an idea how to achieve a goal I had thought impossible: playing baseball  At Philadelphia' s Overbrook School for the Blind I invented a successful variation of baseball  We called it ground ball

	All my life I have set ahead of me a series of goals and then tried to reach them  one at a time  I had to learn my limitations  It was no good to try for something I knew at the start was wildly out of reach because that only invited the bitterness of failure  I would fail sometimes anyway but on the average I made progress
