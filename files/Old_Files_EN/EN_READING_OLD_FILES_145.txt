When we hear that a couple live 11 time zones apart and can afford to come together only once in a long while its natural to offer sympathy for the pain 11We should more fairly envy them for their luck Whatever our longings1 may indicate it is simply a lot easier to love when someone isnt there Far from an unfortunate necessity living apart should be recognised for what it truly is: an advantage So much goes right when we live a long way away:Online or over the phone we never assume that the other person should be able to read our minds without us ever having explained what is actually in them 1We accept that we will have to describe our days as well as our desires in words and pictures We cant help but do that thing that holds couples together: communicate We accept that the other can live without us and therefore make the effort to be the sort of people someone would freely choose to be with 211We work at it We can benefit from what jealousy2 otherwise prevents us from admitting: how much it helps us to feel like desirable potent3 people3to be able to go out and flirt4 with someone else for a while without too many questions being asked In other words how profoundly loyal a whiff of surface disloyalty helps us to be Apart we appreciate 4Its a strange quirk5 of our minds but we only ever notice whats missing: the money we dont have; the weather we long for; the car we dont yet own Yet once anything is securely in our possession it disappears We only see in the sense of notice what isnt there The best way to lose ownership of something is to own it and the surest way to forget your partner exists may be to ensure theyre beside you every night taWhen we were apart we can sample the gentle suffering of loneliness over the intense rage of suffocation6 5We never have to find out how much it can tarnish7 love to be with someone who has a different idea of a cutlery drawer or the correct way to suspend a towel Too often when were cohabiting we locate the difficulty of our relationships in a very erroneous place:We think that it is the wrong person weve mistakenly got together with rather than keeping in mind that were with a pretty right person trying to do an exceptionally tricky8 thing: share a home It may in the end strangely just be a lot easier to love than to share a bathroom Our love stories are suffering from a mistaken cultural hierarchy9 Just as the book is often wrongly thought more important than the essay so the livein relationship is too readily assumed to be superior to the longrange version And yet without ever meaning to do so the longdistance relationship may simply despite all its evident challenges throw up some of the absolutely ideal conditions for true love to thrive We should be wise to imbibe10 a few of the lessons life normally only teaches us when theyre in Sydney and youre in Vancouverand carefully import them into our lives even with the people unfortunate enough to be right next to us efully import them into our lives even with the people unfortunate enough to be right next to us 			us 			imate to be the price of your dream 	                                              	 	After a brief discussion  they agreed to the sum of 300 coins 	                  300      	 	Never have I made such a business deal  So much money for a simple dream of no value  How gullible8 you are  Hassan 	                                                   	 	The two friends then went under the pine tree which the wasp had shown in the dream  Jehdi was amused to see Hassan perspiring9 profusely10 and breaking his back with the shovel11  He continued on until the shovel made a dull sound as if it had struck something hard 	                                                                                 	 	What a surprise for the two merchants when they uncovered an earthen pot full of gold coins  Before breaking it  Hassan noted12 an inscription13 near the handle: "The first of seven "	                                                              	 	The first of seven  That means there should be six more pots buried Jehdi understood  starting to regret the deal he had concluded too quickly 	                                                	 	This time both of them dug with energy and  sure enough  they found the six pots  one after another  each one filled to the brim with gold coins 	                                             	 	Hassan built a huge inn in the city and named it The Bulgy14 Pot  He lived as a rich and satisfied man until his death 	                                        	 	When Hassan was alive  Jehdi often came to visit him and greeted his friend with the words  "Well  Hassan  how are you  I have come to see what has happened to my dream " And then the two comrades patted each other on the back laughing  But every time Jehdi returned home sadder  for he knew that he could never buy back his dream
