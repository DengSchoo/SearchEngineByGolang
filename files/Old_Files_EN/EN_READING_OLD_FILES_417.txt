Most of us would like to accomplish more than what we are able to in a day How many times have you felt that it would be so much easier if you only had a few more extra hours in a day to complete the various tasks that you have on your plate And how many times have you wished that you could do with a lesser1 amount of stress and strain that your workload2 is causing you  The thing you need to know to overcome this feeling of being over laden3 with work all the time is to be able to manage your time better And the most important thing to understand is that time management is not something that you can do as and when you feel that work is getting difficult to handle It is a lifestyle that you need to adopt and practice each and every day of your life It is a habit that will lead you to a life where you have peace of mind better and more efficient work churn out and more time on your hands to do the things you enjoy  There are many techniques that you can adopt to help you in managing your time better and get a kick-start in this process And the best technique to start with is to learn how to focus on the job at hand This can be done once you have prepared a list and prioritized the tasks that you have on hand But once you have decided4 to take up a particular job don't let yourself get distracted on the way Don't allow thoughts on other projects to mingle5 and disturb your thought process Ensure that you are determined6 to complete the job at hand before you allow your mind to take detours7 into other arenas8 awaiting attention Avoid taking any kind of breaks while you are at that task and ensure that you complete it before you consider a cup of coffee or a call that you need to make  and learning new things These small knowledge and experience modules5 will perhaps one day take you to your bigger goal some day They say "Time and Tide waits for no man" If so now stop staring at the screen and utilize6 your time effectively u look stupid  even though it would be easy to do so  They've learnt through bitter experience that the only thing that happens when you make someone look bad is you look bad yourself at life is all about
