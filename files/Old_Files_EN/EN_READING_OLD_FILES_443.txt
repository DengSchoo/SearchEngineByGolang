Happiness comes from external things  We pin our happiness on external things like our appearance bank balance job title travel plans possessions and the opinions of others -- and then suffer as a result  True sustainable happiness comes from within -- by cultivating a mindset based on gratitude1 mindfulness and acceptance  There is a single definition of success  And it involves an established career large house acceptable body shape marriage and annual holidays  Everyone has their own path to walk in this life and what brings true meaning and deep fulfillment differs for all of us  Let go of your need to fit to the status quo Live work date play create travel eat drink move laugh and sing in ways that feel right with your soul That is true success  Life is meant to be hard work  Life is meant to be easy beautiful and overflowing2 with moments of joy and bliss3  The more you listen to your soul and build a life that's true to you the more your actions will feel completely natural and effortless  If life is a constant struggle you're running on empty and you dread4 Mondays it's time to take an honest look at your life -- in a loving way  Life happens to us  Where you are now is a result of the choices you made in the past Where you will be in the future is a result of the choices you are making right now  You are an active participant in the creation of your life So embrace your power as a creator and start choosing thoughts words and actions that make a positive impact and will come back to you in a million magnificent beautiful jaw-dropping ways  There is such a thing as normal and we should measure ourselves against it  There is no such thing as a normal human but there is such a thing as a "normal" you -- where you're completely yourself you love yourself deeply and you think and act in ways that feel aligned5 with your soul  Let your internal compass be your only point of reference  There is an "us" and a "them"  We draw a line around our social and family circles keeping out everyone who doesn't fit neatly6 within our definition of normal interesting or worthwhile  While everyone has vastly different aptitudes7 passions and quirks8 everyone also has the same light within them The light within you is the same light within me within the stranger on the bus and within anyone you consider your enemy  We have to compete for limited resources  Life is meant to be abundant and limitless We create scarcity9 by believing in it instead of focusing our efforts on creating giving and contributing our gift to help humankind reach its highest potential  Relax and feel it deep within your heart that you will always be provided for
