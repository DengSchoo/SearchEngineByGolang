I woke up early today excited over all I get to do before the clock strikes midnight I have responsibilities to fulfill1 today I am important My job is to choose what kind of day I am going to have Today I can complain because the weather is rainy or I can be thankful that the grass is getting watered for free Today I can fell sad that I dont have more money or I can be glad that my finances encourage me to plan my purchases wisely and guide me away from waste Today I can grumble2 about my health or I can rejoice that I am alive Today I can lament3 over all that my parents didnt give me when I was growing up or I can feel grateful that they allowed me to be born Today I can cry because roses have thorns or I can celebrate that thorns have roses Today I can mourn my lack of friends or I can excitedly embark4 upon a quest to discover new relationships Today I can murmur5 dejectedly because I have to do housework or I can feel honored because the Lord has provided shelter for my mind body and soul Today stretches ahead of me waiting to be shaped And here I am the sculptor6 who gets to do the shaping What today will be like is up to me I get to choose what kind of day I will have get to choose what kind of day I will have ls bleached10 white peers across the endless stretch of sand Mesmerized11 by his grandfather he jets down the wet beach as fast as his chubby12 legs can carry him His sisters give chase 	 	A million dancing whitecaps become myriad13 diamonds straining to outshine one another The glimmering14 trail sparkles on the vast and seemingly endless body of water that starts at my feet and disappears into the sky where seagulls dip and swirl15 calling to one another as an anxious mother calls to a wayward child 	 	A chaise lounge dominates the photo In it a woman - my mother - reclines Mom is spread out in the chair like thick sweet frosting on a cake Languid her arms raised above her head her legs splayed pant legs rolled up to expose a goodly length of pale skin Her arms are bare the undersides pasty in comparison to the tops Her smile in repose16 is tender sweet unassuming and peaceful 	 	To my knowledge Mom never owned a bathing suit I don't recall ever seeing her step into the lake and never before had she sunbathed17 That day however was different It was as if all her cares had floated out to deep waters like the unattended beach ball had done just minutes before 	 	We are a large family When my siblings18 and I were young Dad was the one who took us to the beach He sat in the car and watched as we frolicked in the shallows Mom stayed home to ensure we had a hot meal when we returned Perhaps Mom was happy for the few moments of alone time at home in the kitchen as was Dad alone in the car 	 	On this day their grown children with children of our own treat them to dinner on the beach Dad fishes off the dock never swaying from his pleasantries And for once Mom forgets about making dinner 	 	It is a day of memories a day never to be forgotten 	 	My three children are in the photo and Dad is in the background as are two of my sisters and their children but everyone who gazes at the poorly developed photo is drawn19 inexplicably20 to Mom's smile In the photo her face is raised up to the sky To the sun or to our Creator she alone knows Her eyes are closed 	 	I remember how warm it was that day and how she had squinted21 up at me shielding her eyes with both hands 	 	"Are my legs getting red " she'd asked 	 	My eyes brim with unshed tears as I remember the feel of her skin on the palm of my hand Hot The scalding tears run down my face How I wish I could touch her one more time 	 	"No Mom " I replied "But better put some sunscreen on before you get a burn " Reluctantly she'd sat up the peaceful smile disappearing and rolled her pant legs down again 	 	"Save it for the kids " she said her eyes scanning the group of children splashing in and out of the water The whisper of a smile touched her lips as she watched for a long wistful moment With a sigh she rose from the chair and moved toward the car where the coolers awaited 	 	"Maybe we should get lunch going " she said as she opened the first cooler 	 	Now it is my turn to smile Mom was not ready to relinquish22 dinner duties after all On a whim23 I turn my face heavenward and close my eyes I draw a deep breath and search for the special place Mom found that afternoon It comes to me easily Without pomp or ceremony there she is smiling again Tears squeeze from beneath my closed lids and I fervently24 pray that anyone who might come upon me at this moment will say my smile reminds them of Mom's smile that day on the beach so long ago Tender sweet unassuming - and despite our loss it was peaceful on what he really thinks of him  But as I stood before Daniel  I knew that it does matter  My father and I loved each other  Yet  I always regretted never hearing him put his feelings into words and never having the memory of that moment  Now  I could feel my palms sweat and my throat tighten14  Why is it so hard to tell a son something from the heart  My mouth turned dry  and I knew I would be able to get out only a few words clearly 	 	"Daniel " I said  "if I could have picked  I would have picked you "	 	That's all I could say  I wasn't sure he understood what I meant  Then he came toward me and threw his arms around me  For a moment  the world and all its people vanished  and there was just Daniel and me in our home by the sea 	 	He was saying something  but my eyes misted over  and I couldn't understand what he was saying  All I was aware of was the stubble on his chin as his face pressed against mine  And then  the moment ended  I went to work  and Daniel left a few hours later with his girlfriend 	 	That was seven weeks ago  and I think about him when I walk along the beach on weekends  Thousands of miles away  somewhere out past the ocean waves breaking on the deserted15 shore  he might be scurrying16 across Boulevard Saint Germain  strolling through a musty hallway of the Louvre  bending an elbow in a Left Bank café 	 	What I had said to Daniel was clumsy and trite17  It was nothing  And yet  it was everything
