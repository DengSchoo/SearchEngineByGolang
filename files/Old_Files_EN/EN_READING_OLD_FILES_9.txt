If someone gives you an unsatisfactory answer to a question stay quiet and keep eye contact and theyll usually feel pressured to keep talking and reveal more If you feel someone is looking at you try yawning and look around If they yawn you know they were looking at you If you want your friend to carry something just keep talking to them while handing them the bag Most people will automatically take the bag without thinking Have a makeover after end of relationship And show off the new you Pretending not to care is the habit of someone who generally cares the most Writing down negative thoughts and tossing them in a trash can is a psychological trick to improve your mood Intelligent people tend to have less friends than the average person The smarter you are the more selective you become Your favorite song is probably favorite because you associate with an emotional event of your life The person on your mind while youre unable to sleep is usually the person responsible for your happiness pain You appear more attractive to the other person when you make them smile or laugh Women are likely to ask questions to things that they already know answers to Be honest The two most effective treatments for battling depression are exercise and spending time with the pets When your mood goes from happy to sad most of the time; its because youre missing someone When person cries and the first drop comes out of the right eye its Happiness Left eyes is pain But both indicate frustration1  eye its Happiness Left eyes is pain But both indicate frustration1 	e effectively is a great way to save water There's nothing wrong with trying to keep your kitchen clean but you're going through a lot of water if you're in the habit of running your dishwasher every day By waiting until the dishwasher is full you're getting the most bang for your buck11 when it comes to the water you're using And always make sure that you have enough dirty clothing for a full load 	 	6 Use water-efficient appliances 	 	The next time you need to replace a dishwasher washing machine or water heater purchase a water-efficient appliance Not only will this cut back on your water consumption but you'll save money over time when it comes to utility costs 	 	7 Avoid washing your car or use a bucket 	 	Put the hose down and let the rain clean your car for you If you do feel the need to wash your vehicle fill a few buckets instead of using your garden hose to clean your vehicle off and rinse6 it If you use a hose to wash your vehicle you'll use roughly 190 L of water A few buckets will only require 1938 L though en can stand adversity  but if you want to test a man's character  give him power."-Abraham Lincoln
