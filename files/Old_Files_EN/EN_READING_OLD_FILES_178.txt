Thomas Jefferson and James Madison met in 1776 Could it have been any other year They worked together starting then to further American Revolution and later to shape the new scheme of government From the work sprang a friendship perhaps incomparable in intimacy1 and the trustfulness of collaboration2 and induration It lasted 50 years It included pleasure and utility but over and above them there were shared purpose a common end and an enduring goodness on both sides Four and a half months before he died when he was ailing3 debtridden and worried about his impoverished4 family Jefferson wrote to his longtime friend His words and Madisons reply remind us that friends are friends until death They also remind us that sometimes a friendship has a bearing on things larger than the friendship itself for has there ever been a friendship of greater public consequence than this one The friendship which has subsisted5 between us now half a century the harmony of our po1itical principles and pursuits have been sources of constant happiness to me through that long period If ever the earth has beheld6 a system of administration conducted with a single and steadfast7 eye to the general interest and happiness of those committed to it one which protected by truth can never known reproach it is that to which our lives have been devoted8 To myself you have been a pillar of support throughout life Take care of me when dead and be assured that I should leave with you my last affections A week later Madison repliedYou cannot look back to the long period of our private friendship and political harmony with more affecting recollections than I do If they are a source of pleasure to you what arent they not to be to me We cannot be deprived of the happy consciousness of the pure devotion to the public good with Which we discharge the trust committed to us and I indulge a confidence that sufficient evidence will find in its way to another generation to ensure after we are gone whatever of justice may be withheld9 whilst we are here whilst we are here "ach pain heartache or whatever -- you scream loudly; and anyone who comes to talk to you you don't talk in the usual way anymore because you're in pain 	 	Similarly when you are in a mental or psychological pain you talk also in a very grouchy5 way very cross But that is understandable So if we -- any so-called loving partner or family member -- do not understand even this very least very basic concept then we're finished Then we are really in a bad situation It's not that the partner will do anything to us Whether he does anything to us later or not that is no problem The problem is us The problem is we degrade ourselves that we make less of a being of ourselves than we should be than we are supposed to be or that we really are So do not make less of a being of yourselves to buy my Mama a white rose  but I didn't ask him  but he gave me enough to buy the doll and a rose for my Mama  She loves white rose so much  "In a few minutes the aunt came back and I wheeled my cart away 
	 
	I could not keep from thinking about the little boy as I finished my shoppong in a ttally different spirit than when I had started  And I kept remembering a story I had seen in the newspaper several days earlier about a drunk driver hitting a car and killing7 a little girl and the Mother was in serious condition  The family was deciding on whether to remove the life support  Now surely this little boy did not belong with that story 
	 
	Two days later I read in the paper where the family had disconnected the life support and the young woman had died  I could not forget the little boy and just kept wondering if the two were somehow connected  Later that day  I could not help myself and I went out and bought aome white roses and took them to the funeral home where the yough woman was  And there she was holding a lovely white rose  the beautiful doll  and the picture of the little boy in the store  I left there in tears  thier life changed forever  The love that little boy had for his little sisiter and his mother was overwhel  And in a split8 second a drunk driver had ripped9 the life of that little boy to pieces ime  he met the love of his life  he raised a family  and he graduated from college Magna Cum Laude  During his Naval10 career  he inspired many young people  who without him  might not have believed in themselves  Steve began a second career after the Navy  and he continues to inspire others  as an adjunct professor in a nearby college Miss White left a great legacy11  She saved one boy who has changed many lives
