A friend of mine named Paul received an automobile1 from his brother as Christmas present On Christmas eve when Paul came out of his office a street urchin2 was looking around the shining new car admiring it  "Is this your car Mister " he said  Paul nodded "My brother gave it to me for Christmas " The boy was astounded3 "You mean your brother gave it to you and didn't cost you anything " "Boy I wish " he hesitated  Of course Paul knew what he was going to wish for He was going to wish he has a brother like that But what the lad said jarred Paull all the way down his heels  "I wish " the boy went on "that I could be a brother like that " Paul looked at the boy in astonishment4 then inpulsivly he added "Would you like to take a ride in my car " "Oh yes I'd love that " After a short ride the boy turned his eyes aglow5 said "Mister would you mind driving in front of my house " Paul smiled a little He thought he knew what the lad wanted He wanted to show his neighbours that he could ride home in a big automobile But Paul was wrong again  "Would you stop at those with two steps " the boy asked  He ran up stairs Then in a little while Paul heard him coming back but he was not coming fast He was carrying his little crippled brother He set him down on the bottom step Then a sort of squeezed up against him and pointed6 to the car  "There she is buddy7 just like I told you upstairs His brother gave it to him for Christmas and didn't cost hime a cent And some day I'm gonna give you one just like it Then you can see for yourself all the prettiest things in the windows that I was trying to tell you about " Paul got off and lifted the lad into the front of his car The shinning eyed old brother crimbed in beside him And three of them began a memorable8 holiday ride  That Christmas eve Paul learned what Jesus meant when he said "It is more blessed to give than to receive " "lways better to be busy rather than idle Now hasn't everyone heard that an idle mind is a devil's workshop Behind every successful man is a devotedly7 followed hectic schedule rather than a woman th century Russia  Each character is representative of one of the ruling classes   There is the father Fyodor  the landowner who is negligent14 about his land  but greedy in using its produce for himself  There's Dmitri  who has been passed around from house to house  There's the skeptic15 Ivan  who wishes to live more among cold concepts than people  And gentle Alyosha  the mystic and religious peacemaker  and the illegitimate Smerdyakov   Throughout are themes of love  law  and duty  which makes this one of the best Dostoyesky books to read besides Crime and Punishment job  but your actions say otherwise  that's also important  What do you do with this insight  You can use it to make more beneficial choices in your life  By being honest with yourself based on your previous actions  your actions moving forward will be based on truth instead of just what you tell yourself  Take time out during the day for quiet time to listen to your inner voice  I call this inner voice the voice of God  This is similar to point number one  but it takes it a step further - beyond the natural mind to the supernatural heart  You may want to use your quiet time to meditate6 or pray  However you use this time  the key is to shut out all of the noise around you by focusing deep within yourself  Breathing deeply during quiet time will also help you focus  I know it's hard to find quiet time during a particularly busy day  but it's so important - even if it's just 10 minutes a day and you have to sneak7 away to get it  Quiet time can really make a difference in your life  It enables you to hear God speaking to your heart reminding you of His perfect love for you  Despite what your subconscious8 may be telling you  you can have love with no limits  The key is to unconditionally love yourself first
