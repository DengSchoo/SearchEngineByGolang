I will greet this day with love in my heart  For this is the greatest secret of success in all ventures Muscle can split a shield and even destroy life but only the unseen power of love can open the hearts of men and until I master this art I will remain no more than a peddler in the market place I will make love my greatest weapon and none on whom I call can defend against its force  My reasoning they may counter; my speech they may distrust; my apparel they may disapprove1; my face they may reject; and even my bargains may cause them suspicion; yet my love will melt all hearts liken to the sun whose rays soften2 the coldest clay  I will greet this day with love in my heart  And how will I do this Henceforth will I look on all things with love and I will be born again I will love the sun for it warms my bones; yet I will love the rain for it cleanses3 my spirit I will love the light for it shows me the way; yet I will love the darkness for it shows me the stars I will welcome happiness for it enlarges my heart; yet I will endure sadness for it opens my soul I will acknowledge rewards for they are my due; yet I will welcome obstacles for they are my challenge  I will greet this day with love in my heart  And how will I speak I will laud4 mine enemies and they will become friends; I will encourage my friends and they will become brothers Always will I dig for reasons to applaud; never will I scratch for excuses to gossip When I am tempted5 to criticize I will bite on my tongue; when I am moved to praise I will shout from the roofs  Is it not so that birds the wind the sea and all nature speaks with the music of praise for their creator Cannot I speak with the same music to his children Henceforth will I remember this secret and it will change my life  And how will I act  I will love all manner of men for each has qualities to be admired even though they be hidden With love I will tear down the wall of suspicion and hate which they have built round their hearts and in its place will I build bridges so that my love may enter their souls  I will love the ambitious for they can inspire me I will love the failures for they can teach me I will love the kings for they are but human; I will love the meek6 for they are divine I will love the rich for they are yet lonely  I will love the poor for they are so many I will love the young for the faith they hold; I will love the old for the wisdom they share I will love the beautiful for their eyes of sadness; I will love the ugly for their souls of peace  But how will I react to the actions of others With love For just as love is my weapon to open the hearts of men love is also my shield to repulse7 the arrows of hate and the spears of anger Adversity and discouragement will beat against my new shield and become as the softest of rains  And how will I confront each whom I meet In only one way In silence and myself I will address him and say "I love you" Though spoken in silence these words will shine in my eyes unwrinkled my brow bring a smile to my lips and echo in my voice; and his heart will be opened ep further - beyond the natural mind to the supernatural heart You may want to use your quiet time to meditate6 or pray However you use this time the key is to shut out all of the noise around you by focusing deep within yourself Breathing deeply during quiet time will also help you focus I know it's hard to find quiet time during a particularly busy day but it's so important - even if it's just 10 minutes a day and you have to sneak7 away to get it Quiet time can really make a difference in your life It enables you to hear God speaking to your heart reminding you of His perfect love for you  Despite what your subconscious8 may be telling you you can have love with no limits The key is to unconditionally love yourself first nsible for the accident had to be prosecuted15  which meant Chuck and his ex-wife would have to stay in contact  Those ugly jealousies16 from the past began to resurface when  night after night  he talked to her  seldom discussing their conversations with me  And it stung when friends inquired only about Chuck"s coping  or sent sympathy cards addressed just to him  forgetting about me and even our two children  Some belittled17 my grieving because I was "just" a stepparent  Did anyone realize my loss and pain  I"d had strong maternal feelings for Conan; he considered me his second mother - or did he  As the weeks turned into months  that question haunted me  dominating my thoughts  I became driven to understand just what my role had been #p#    #e# I rummaged18 through boxes of photos and dug out old journals  searching the house for mementos19  even Christmas ornaments20 he had made  There were several comforting journal excerpts21  one describing Mother"s Day phone calls from Conan to me  and a beautiful white poinsettia he gave me at Christmas  And I cherished the memories old photos brought back - his loving bear hugs after cooking his favorite meal - or a kiss for simply doing his laundry  As comforting as these things were  they still weren"t enough  One beautiful spring day  almost a year after he died  I was lovingly caressing22 the pressed rose from his grave that I kept in my Bible  Suddenly  I felt compelled to visit his grave alone  I had never done that before  but I desperately23 needed some answers  Arriving at the gravesite  I remembered Chuck mentioning that the permanent headstone had recently arrived  Chuck had told Conan"s mom to select what she wanted  As I looked down on the shiny marble surface  I noticed she had chosen a bronze sports emblem24  along with a picture of Conan that had been permanently25 embedded26 under a thick layer of glass  I bent27 down and lovingly ran my fingers over his engraved28 name and the dates commemorating29 his short life  Through a mist of tears  memories of a rambunctious30  fun-loving little boy filled my heart  The child I"d mothered part-time for so many years may not have come through my body  but I had been chosen by God to provide a maternal influence in his life  Not to take his mother"s place  but to be just a "step" away  I suddenly felt very honored to have been chosen  "It was a privilege to be your stepmother " I whispered out loud  bending to kiss his picture  Finally  a sense of peace was beginning  With a heavy sigh  I got up to leave  But as I turned to walk away  the sun glistened31 on the border of the headstone  causing me to look back  "Oh my gosh  How could I have not noticed it before " The entire border of the headstone was trimmed in gold shafts32 of wheat       exactly like a gold shaft-of-wheat pin Conan had given me years ago  Chills ran up and down my spine33  I hadn"t seen that pin in years  Somehow  I just knew it was the missing link  I had to find that pin  The ride home was a blur1  I was so excited  Finally  I was upstairs in my bedroom tearing apart my jewelry34 box  Where was it  Dumping the contents on the bed  I frantically35 tossed earrings36 and pins to and fro  Nothing  God  this is important  Please help me find it  I prayed  Turning from the bed I felt compelled to search my dresser  Rummaging37 through drawer after drawer proved futile38  until finally  in the last drawer  clear in the back I felt it  It was a small  white box with my name scribbled39 on top in a child"s handwriting  Prying40 it open  I was instantly transported back in time  Conan had been about ten years old  and it was the night before going on vacation to Florida  He was going with us  and I was packing in my room when I heard a knock on my door  Conan stood there  his eyes downcast and his hands behind his back  "What is it  son " I asked  concerned by this unexpected visit  Shuffling41 his feet  he quickly mumbled42  "I don"t know why I don"t call you "Mom" very often  even though I call my stepdad "Dad "" I hugged him and reassured him he was free to call me whatever he was comfortable with  Then suddenly  with a wry43 smile on his pudgy face  he handed me the small  white box  "You choose " he said  and darted44 from the room  Assuming I"d find two items inside the box  I opened it  Instead  I found the single gold wheat pin he"d bought at a garage sale with his own money  Scribbled inside the lid of the box were the words  "I Love You  To Mom or Connie " That had been almost a decade ago  yet as I pushed the spilled contents of my jewelry box aside and slowly sat down on the edge of the bed  it felt like yesterday  Thank you  God  for finding this pin  and for the closure that comes with it  Wiping the tears from my face  I reflected on an angelic little boy whose heart beat close to mine  I still choose "Mom "
