Once a circle missed a wedge The circle wanted to be whole so it went around looking for its missing piece But because it was incomplete and therefore could roll only very slowly it admired the flowers along the way It chatted with worms It enjoyed the sunshine It found lots of different pieces but none of them fit So it left them all by the side of the road and kept on searching Then one day the circle found a piece that fit perfectly1 It was so happy Now it could be whole with nothing missing It incorporated the missing piece into itself and began to roll Now that it was a perfect circle it could roll very fast too fast to notice flowers or talk to the worms When it realized how different the world seemed when it rolled so quickly it stopped left its found piece by the side of the road and rolled slowly away The lesson of the story I suggested was that in some strange sense we are more whole when we are missing something The man who has everything is in some ways a poor man He will never know what it feels like to yearn2 to hope to nourish his soul with the dream of something better He will never know the experience of having someone who loves him give him something he has always wanted or never had There is a wholeness about the person who has come to terms with his limitations who has been brave enough to let go of his unrealistic dreams and not feel like a failure for doing so There is a wholeness about the man or woman who has learned that he or she is strong enough to go through a tragedy and survive she can lose someone and still feel like a complete person Life is not a trap set for us by God so that he can condemn3 us for failing Life is not a spelling bee where no matter how many words youve gotten right youre disqualified if you make one mistake Life is more like a baseball season where even the best team loses one third of its games and even the worst team has its days of brilliance4 Our goal is to win more games than we lose When we accept that imperfection is part of being human and when we can continue rolling through life and appreciate it we will have achieved a wholeness that others can only aspire5 to That I believe is what God asks of us not Be perfect not Dont even make a mistake but Be whole If we are brave enough to love strong enough to forgive generous enough to rejoice in anothers happiness and wise enough to know there is enough love to go around for us all then we can achieve a fulfillment that no other living creature will ever know iving creature will ever know our original goal says Kelsey Byers lifestyle coach and fitness blogger behind Good Morning Fit who has lost 50lbs Byers' husband helped her stick to her goals;
