The only problem unconsciously assumed by all Chinese philosophers to be of any importance is: How shall we enjoy life and who can best enjoy life No perfectionism no straining after the unattainable no postulating1 of he unknowable; but taking poor modal human nature as it is how shall we organize our life so that we can woke peacefully endure nobly and live happily  Who are we That is first question It is a question almost impossible to answer But we all agree with the busy self occupied in our daily activities is not quite the real self We are quite sure we have lost something in the mere2 pursuit of living When we watch a person running about looking for something in a field the wise man can set a puzzle for all the spectator to solve: what has that person lost Some one thinks is a watch; another thinks it is a diamond brooch; and others will essay other guesses After all the guesses have failed the wise man who really doesn't know what the person is seeking after tells the company: "I'll tell you He has lost some breath " And no one can deny that he is right So we often forget our true self in the pursuit of living like a bird forgetting its own danger in pursuit of a mantis3 which again forgets its own danger in pursuit of another move on again  By travelling like this  you suspend all experience; the present ceased to be a reality: you might just as well be dead den  in a cool house  abiding10 single there " Loneliness is most acutely felt with other people  for with others even with a lover sometimes  we suffer from our differences of taste  temperament mood  Human intercourse11 often demands that we soften12 the edge of perception  or withdraw at the very instant of personal truth for fear of hurting  or of being inappropriately present  which is to say naked  in a social situation  Alone we can afford to be wholly whatever we are  and to feel whatever we feel absolutely  That is a great luxury  For me the most interesting thing about a solitary life  and mine has been that for the last twenty years  is that it becomes increasingly rewarding  When I can wake up and watch the sun rise over the ocean  as I do most days  and know that I have an entire day ahead  uninterrupted  in which to write a few pages  take a walk with my dog  lie down in the afternoon for a long think (why does one think better in a horizontal position )  read and listen to music  I am flooded with happiness  I'm lonely only when I am overtired  when I have worked too long without a break  when from the time being I feel empty and need filling up  And I am lonely sometimes when I come back home after a lecture trip  when I have seen a lot of people and talked a lot  and am full to the brim with experience that needs to be sorted out  Then for a little while the house feels huge and empty  and I wonder where my self is hiding  It has to be recaptured slowly by watering the plants and perhaps by looking again at each one as though it were a person  It takes a while  as I watch the surf blowing up in fountains at the end of the field  but the moment comes when the world falls away  and the self emerges again from the deep unconscious  bringing back all I have recently experienced to be explored and slowly understood  when I can converse13 again with my hidden powers  and so grow  and so be renewed  till death do us part
