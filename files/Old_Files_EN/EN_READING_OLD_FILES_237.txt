Every day I anxiously wait for you to get to class I cant wait for us to smile at each other and say good morning Some days when you arrive only seconds before the lecture begins Im incredibly impatient Instead of reading the Daily Cal I anticipate your footsteps from behind and listen for your voice Today is one of your late days But I dont mind because after a month of desperately1 desiring to ask you out today Im going to Encourage me because letting you know I like you seems as risky2 to me as skydiving into the sea I know that dating has changed dramatically in the past few years and for many women asking men out is not at all daring But I was raised in a traditional European household where simply the thought of my asking you out spells naughty Growing up I learned that men call ask and pay for the date During my three years at Berkeley I have learned otherwise Many Berkeley women have brightened their social lives by taking the initiative with men My girlfriends insist that its essential for women to participate more in the dating process I cant sit around and wait anymore my former roommate once blurted3 out Hard as it is I have to ask guys out if I want to date at all Wonderful More women are inviting4 men out and men say they are delighted often relieved that dating no longer solely5 depends on their willingness and courage to take the first step Then why am I digging my nails into my hand trying to muster6 up courage I keep telling myself to relax since dating is less stereotypical7 and more casual today A college date means anything from studying together to sex Most of my peers prefer casual dating anyway because its cheaper and more comfortable Students have fewer anxiety attacks when they ask somebody to play tennis than when they plan a formal dinner date They enjoy lastminute lets make dinner together dates because they not only avoid hassling with attire8 and transportation but also dont have time to agonize9 Casual dating also encourages people to form healthy friendship prior to starting relationships My roommate and her boyfriend were friends for four months before their chemistries clicked They went to movies and meals and often got together with mutual10 friends They alternated paying the dinner check He was like a girlfriend my roommate once laughedblushing Men and women relax and get to know each other more easily through such friendships Another friends of mine believes that casual dating is improving peoples social lives When she wants to let a guy know she is interested shell say Hey lets go get a yogurt Who pays for it My past dates have taught me some things You dont know if Ill get the wrong idea if you treat me for dinner and I dont know if Ill deny your pleasure or offend you by insisting on paying for myself John whipped out his wallet on our first date before I could suggest we go Dutch During our afterdinner stroll he told me he was interested in dating me on a steady basis After I explained I was more interested in a friendship he told me he would have understood has I paid for my dinner Ive practically stopped treating women on dates he said defensively Its safer and more comfortable when we each pay for ourselves John has assumed that because I graciously accepted his treat I was in love He was mad at himself for treating me and I regretted allowing him to Larry on the other hand blushed when I offered to pay for my meal on our first date I unzipped my purse and flung out my wallet and he looked at me as if I had addressed him in a foreign language Hesitant I asked politely How much do I owe you Larry muttered Uh uh you really dont owe me anything but if you insistInsist I though I only offered To Larry my gesture was a suggestion of rejection11 Men and women alike are confused about who should ask whom out and who should pay While I treasure my femininity adore gentlemen and delight in a traditional formal date I also believe in equality I am grateful for casual dating because it has improved my social life immensely by making me an active participant in the process Now I can not only receive roses but can also give them Casual dating is a worthwhile adventure because it works No magic formula guarantees he will say yes I just have to relax be Laura and ask him out in an unthreatening manner If my friends are right hell be flattered Sliding into his desk he taps my shoulder and says Hi Laura whats up Good morning I answer with nervous chills Hey how would you like to have lunch after class on Friday You mean after the midterm he says encouragingly Id love to go to lunch with you We have a date I smile ou mean after the midterm " he says encouragingly "I'd love to go to lunch with you "	 	"We have a date " I smile st said  "It is only our princes  who are shouting for joy at our approach " They came to another grove of trees  where all the leaves were of gold; and afterwards to a third  where the leaves were all glittering16 diamonds  And the soldier broke a branch from each; and every time there was a loud noise  which made the youngest sister tremble with fear  But the eldest still said it was only the princes  who were crying for joy  They went on till they came to a great lake; and at the side of the lake there lay twelve little boats with twelve handsome princes in them  who seemed to be waiting there for the princesses  One of the princesses went into each boat  and the soldier stepped into the same boat as the youngest  As they were rowing over the lake  the prince who was in the boat with the youngest princess and the soldier said  "I do not know why it is  but though I am rowing with all my might we do not get on so fast as usual  and I am quite tired: the boat seems very heavy today " "It is only the heat of the weather " said the princess  "I am very warm  too " On the other side of the lake stood a fine  illuminated17 castle from which came the merry music of horns and trumpets18  There they all landed  and went into the castle  and each prince danced with his princess; and the soldier  who was still invisible  danced with them too  When any of the princesses had a cup of wine set by her  he drank it all up  so that when she put the cup to her mouth it was empty  At this  too  the youngest sister was terribly frightened  but the eldest always silenced her  They danced on till three o'clock in the morning  and then all their shoes were worn out  so that they were obliged to leave  The princes rowed them back again over the lake (but this time the soldier placed himself in the boat with the eldest princess); and on the opposite shore they took leave of each other  the princesses promising19 to come again the next night  When they came to the stairs  the soldier ran on before the princesses  and laid himself down  And as the twelve  tired sisters slowly came up  they heard him snoring in his bed and they said  "Now all is quite safe"  Then they undressed themselves  put away their fine clothes  pulled off their shoes  and went to bed  In the morning the soldier said nothing about what had happened  but determined to see more of this strange adventure  and went again on the second and third nights  Everything happened just as before: the princesses danced till their shoes were worn to pieces  and then returned home  On the third night the soldier carried away one of the golden cups as a token of where he had been  As soon as the time came when he was to declare the secret  he was taken before the king with the three branches and the golden cup; and the twelve princesses stood listening behind the door to hear what he would say  The king asked him  "Where do my twelve daughters dance at night " The soldier answered  "With twelve princes in a castle underground " And then he told the king all that had happened  and showed him the three branches and the golden cup which he had brought with him  The king called for the princesses  and asked them whether what the soldier said was true and when they saw that they were discovered  and that it was of no use to deny what had happened  they confessed it all  So the king asked the soldier which of the princesses he would choose for his wife; and he answered  "I am not very young  so I will have the eldest " -- and they were married that very day  and the soldier was chosen to be the king's heir1
