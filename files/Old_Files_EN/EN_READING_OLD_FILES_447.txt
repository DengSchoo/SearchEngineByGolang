Being told I would be expected to talk here I inquired what sort of talk I ought to make They said it should be something suitable to youth-something didactic instructive or something in the nature of good advice Very well I have a few things in my mind which I have often longed to say for the instruction of the young; for it is in one's tender early years that such things will best take root and be most enduring and most valuable First then I will say to you my young friends -- and I say it beseechingly1 urgingly -- Always obey your parents when they are present This is the best policy in the long run because if you don't they will make you Most parents think they know better than you do and you can generally make more by humoring that superstition2 than you can by acting3 on your own better judgment4  Be respectful to your superiors if you have any also to strangers and sometimes to others If a person offend you and you are in doubt as to whether it was intentional5 or not do not resort to extreme measures; simply watch your chance and hit him with a brick That will be sufficient If you shall find that he had not intended any offense6 come out frankly7 and confess yourself in the wrong when you struck him; acknowledge it like a man and say you didn't mean to Yes always avoid violence; in this age of charity and kindliness8 the time has gone by for such things Leave dynamite9 to the low and unrefined  Go to bed early get up early- this is wise Some authorities say get up with the sun; some say get up with one thing others with another But a lark10 is really the best thing to get up with It gives you a splendid reputation with everybody to know that you get up with the lark; and if you get the right kind of lark and work at him right you can easily train him to get up at half past nine every time -- it's no trick at all hink and act in ways that feel aligned5 with your soul  Let your internal compass be your only point of reference  There is an "us" and a "them"  We draw a line around our social and family circles  keeping out everyone who doesn't fit neatly6 within our definition of normal  interesting or worthwhile  While everyone has vastly different aptitudes7  passions and quirks8  everyone also has the same light within them  The light within you is the same light within me  within the stranger on the bus  and within anyone you consider your enemy  We have to compete for limited resources  Life is meant to be abundant and limitless  We create scarcity9 by believing in it  instead of focusing our efforts on creating  giving and contributing our gift to help humankind reach its highest potential  Relax and feel it deep within your heart that you will always be provided for
