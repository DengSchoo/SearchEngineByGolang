Dear World: My son starts school today  It's going to be strange and new to him for a while and I wish you would sort of treat him gently  You see up to now he's been king of the roost  He's been boss of the backyard  I have always been around to repair his wounds and to soothe1 his feelings  But now--things are going to be different  This morning he's going to walk down the front steps wave his hand and start on his great adventure that will probably include wars and tragedy and sorrow  To live his life in the world he has to live in will require faith and love and courage  So World I wish you would sort of take him by his young hand and teach him the things he will have to know  Teach him - but gently if you can  Teach him that for every scoundrel there is a hero; that for every crooked2 politician there is a dedicated3 leader; that for every enemy there is a friend  Teach him the wonders of books  Give him quiet time to ponder the eternal mystery of birds in the sky bees in the sun and flowers on the green hill  Teach him it is far more honorable to fail than to cheat  Teach him to have faith in his own ideas even if everyone tells him they are wrong  Teach him to sell his brawn4 and brains to the highest bidder5 but never to put a price on his heart and soul  Teach him to close his ears to a howling mob and to stand and fight if he thinks he's right  Teach him gently World but don't coddle him because only the test of fire makes fine steel  This is a big order World but see what you can do  He's such a nice little fellow  think about things in some way and the perspective with what we look at them for the first time remain in our mind  Our mind intends to take this perspective as true and makes way for it to follow  So on thinking well the good happens and wrong thought brings unhappy situations  Human beings learn from the situations faced in life and their thinking is affected7 by the circumstances faced  This in turn affects the thinking  Thus our life and our thoughts are mutually related  To lead a good life it is desired to think good  So is rightly said  "What you think is not what you are  but what you THINK is what you are "
