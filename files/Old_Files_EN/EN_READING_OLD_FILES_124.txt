Once there was a fish who lived in the great ocean and because the water was transparent1 and always conveniently got out of the way of his nose when he moved along he didnt know he was in the ocean Well one day the fish did a very dangerous thing he began to think: Surely I am a most remarkable2 being since I can move around like this in the middle of empty space Then the fish became confused because of thinking about moving and swimming and he suddenly had an anxiety convulsion and thought he had forgotten how At that moment he looked down and saw the yawning chasm3 of the ocean depths and he was terrified that he would drop Then he thought: If I could catch hold of my tail in my mouth I could hold myself up And so he curled himself up and snapped at his tail Unfortunately his spine4 wasnt quite supple5 enough so he missed As he went on trying to catch hold of his tail the yawning black abyss below became ever more terrible and he was brought to the edge of total nervous breakdown6 The fish was about to give up when the ocean who had been watching with mixed feelings of pity and amusement said What are you doing Oh said the fish Im terrified of falling into the deep dark abyss and Im trying to catch hold of my tail in my mouth to hold myself up So the ocean said Well youve been trying that for a long time now and still you havent fallen down How come Oh of course I havent fallen down yet said the fish because becauseIm swimming Well came the reply I am the Great Ocean in which you live and move and are able to be a fish and I have given all of myself to you in which to swim and I support you all the time you swim Instead of exploring the length breadth depth and height of my expanse you are wasting your time pursuing your own end From then on the fish put his own end behind him where it belonged and set out to explore the ocean plore the ocean 	e ocean 	 the whole society 		On the other hand a stable job is usually despised by people They think it shows a persons lack of ambition and even lack of merits 		But all these successful cases born under great risks are just like the thought that you grow faster in severe competition They are both survivor4 bias5 		The ones who can show up in front of you and tell you this are the minority who survived Most of the others have already died and disappeared They dont have the chance to come and warn you 		Yes this is the current job market Many young people who came to the first-tier cities ended up in devastating6 failures 		And you wont know these peoples stories 	hips  They'll instruct us in Latin and how to measure the circumference10 of a circle long before they teach us these core subjects: work and love

	That said  it isn't that all we need to do to succeed at life is flunk3 school  A good life requires us to do two very tricky11 things: be a very good boy or girl for 20 years  and simultaneously12  never really believe blindly in the long-term validity or seriousness of what we're being asked to study  We need to be outwardly entirely obedient while inwardly intelligently and unashamedly rebellious13

	 omething you're adamant9 to do  You don't want to be that person who regrets it 30 years from now  do you 
	 
	2 You can adjust your actions along the way 
	 
	Ready  aim  fire  You've heard of the saying  right  Well what happens if you spend all your time aiming  and not firing  You'll never hit anything  That's basically what you're doing by thinking too much and not getting started  Ready  fire  aim should be your approach  You might not get it right on the first shot  but you can adjust your aim as you go along 
	 
	It's better to make a mistake than do nothing at all 
	 
	This ties in with the last point I just made  I don't like to make mistakes  you don't like to mistakes  nobody likes to make mistakes  But nobody's perfect so it's impossible not to make a mistake  As great as computers and smartphones are  even they can make mistakes  You can't get away from it  And that's OK  Just be sure to get started on whatever you've been delaying for so long  And when you do make a mistake  learn from it and get it right the next time  Then you'll be way ahead  I can guarantee you that
