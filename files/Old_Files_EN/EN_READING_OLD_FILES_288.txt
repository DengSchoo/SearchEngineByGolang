seemed less convinced and frowned "You know Mom " he said "sometimes when I have to do something important I get kind of scared " Grownups feel that way too he was assured but the decision was left to him His deliberations took only a few minutes  "Okay " Patrick said "I"ll do it " From the time he was an infant Patrick has enjoyed an unusual passion for music By age four he could pound out several bars of Wagner"s Ride of the Valkyries on the piano   For the next week Patrick practiced his stanza6 several times with his mother A rehearsal7 at the church went well Still I could only envision myself at age five singing into a microphone before hundreds of people When Christmas Eve arrived my expectations were limited  Catherine our daughter Melanie and I sat with the congregation in darkness as a spotlight8 found my son standing9 alone at the microphone He was dressed in white with a pair of angel wings  Slowly confidently Patrick hit every note As his voice washed over the people he seemed a true angel a true bestower of Christmas miracles  There was eternity10 in Patrick"s voice that night a beauty rich enough to penetrate11 any reserve At the sound of my son heavy tears welled at the corners of my eyes  His song was soon over and the congregation applauded Catherine brushed away tears Melanie sobbed12 next to me  After the service I moved to congratulate Patrick but he had more urgent priorities "Mom " he said as his costume was stripped away "I have to go to the bathroom " As Patrick disappeared the pastor13 wished me a Merry Christmas but emotion choked off my reply Outside the sanctuary14 I received congratulations from fellow church members  I found my son as he emerged from the bathroom "Patrick I need to talk to you about something " I said smiling I took him by the hand and led him into a room where we could be alone I knelt to his height and admired his young face the large blue eyes the dusting of freckles15 on his nose and cheeks the dimple on one side  He looked at my moist eyes quizzically #p##e# "Patrick do you remember when you asked me why you had never seen me cry " He nodded  "Well I"m crying now " "Why Dad " "Your singing was so wonderful it made me cry " Patrick smiled proudly and flew into my arms  "Sometimes " my son said into my shoulder "life is so beautiful you have to cry " Our moment together was over too soon Untold16 treasures awaited our five-year-old beneath the tree at home but I wasn"t ready for the traditional plunge17 into Christmas just yet I handed Catherine the keys and set off for the mile-long hike home  The night was cold and crisp I crossed a park and admired the full moon hanging low over a neighborhood brightly lit in the colors of the season As I turned toward home I met a car moving slowly down the street a family taking in the area"s Christmas lights Someone rolled down a window  "Merry Christmas " a child"s voice yelled out to me  "Merry Christmas " I yelled back And the tears began to flow all over again
