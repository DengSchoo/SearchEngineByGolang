I just went through a very tough time of my life And the improbable unfolding of recent events has lead me to consider that no one thing is one thing only People keep defining whats familiar with new everevolving meanings By doing so we release ourselves from the expected the familiar into something unforeseen And it is in this unfamilar realm that we find new possibilities It is in the unknown that we find hope Some people kept learning hard for a time in their life but then they decided1 that theyve known what they need to know They developed a mental immune system They refuse to accept anything which this system finds unsettling Sometimes they even attack when they see such things They have stopped evolving And sometimes I even found myself doing similar things So Im actually writing all this to make myself remember that the search for knowledge is an endless path Lets be each others reminder2 my friend Keep learning Keep evolving Keep being humble3 and hungry er2 my friend 		 	Keep learning 		 	Keep evolving 		 	Keep being humble3 and hungry 	 reading literature  written work thought to have artistic3 merit  that has the best effect  He told the BBC that when reading something for pleasure  "the brain begins to work from different parts  from a different hemisphere and it gets excited  it gets pre-emotional  and you can see the brain coming to life "	 	Of course  it's easy in our smartphone generation to ditch a good book and fiddle4 with our phones instead  But opening up a paperback5 could be a simple way to help boost or maintain our mental health  It's thought they can help you set targets and find focus  And they may allow you see that awkward situation you've been anxious about for weeks from someone else's perspective 	 	If you're not an avid6 reader it can be hard to know where to begin  If the Reading Agency book list doesn't appeal  you could to read book reviews  visit a library or bookshop or ask a friend  Once you've found the right text  you'll be hooked  And if you still love your technology  you could always use an e-reader at fear is never as bad as we believe it to be 
	 
	5 It's better than over analyzing4 what you want to do 
	 
	You know what happens when you start over analyzing something  You stress yourself out  You wear yourself out  you worry  you over think  you make stuff up in your head  and you over exaggerate  What an imagination our brains have  But seriously speaking  there's only so much analyzing you can do  At some point you're going to have to kick your ass5 into gear  At some point you'll have to put the key in the ignition  start the engine  and push the pedal  You can't do that with your mind 
	 
	4 Procrastinating6 won't get you anywhere 
	 
	Getting started is easy  simple  and doable  Yet procrastinating is also easy to do  Ironic7 isn't it  But the truth is  delaying what you've been dying to do isn't going to benefit you  At best  it'll hinder you in more ways than one  Remember what I said earlier about what we do everyday is a habit  Well If you procrastinate8 enough  that habit will creep into other parts of your life as well  If you procrastinate with simple things  you'll procrastinate with harder things  One leads to another  Start small If you must  but at the least you need to get started 
	 
	3 The last thing you want to do is regret not starting 
	 
	Regretting what you've done is one thing  but regretting what you've never done is another  Lets be honest  regretting what you haven't done is so much worse  Especially when it's something you're adamant9 to do  You don't want to be that person who regrets it 30 years from now  do you 
	 
	2 You can adjust your actions along the way 
	 
	Ready  aim  fire  You've heard of the saying  right  Well what happens if you spend all your time aiming  and not firing  You'll never hit anything  That's basically what you're doing by thinking too much and not getting started  Ready  fire  aim should be your approach  You might not get it right on the first shot  but you can adjust your aim as you go along 
	 
	It's better to make a mistake than do nothing at all 
	 
	This ties in with the last point I just made  I don't like to make mistakes  you don't like to mistakes  nobody likes to make mistakes  But nobody's perfect so it's impossible not to make a mistake  As great as computers and smartphones are  even they can make mistakes  You can't get away from it  And that's OK  Just be sure to get started on whatever you've been delaying for so long  And when you do make a mistake  learn from it and get it right the next time  Then you'll be way ahead  I can guarantee you that t  tackle the task that you can't stop thinking about  The longer you try to ignore it  the more frustrated11 you're gonna feel  You'll never feel satisfied until you get that big-ticket item out of your head

	Number three  the power of reliability12 
	  ，       。
	 
	Even if you're great about setting new goals  you may have a hard time following through  You might make a to-do list and lay out specific concrete steps but what stops you from bailing14 at the last minute  Let's say you want to start working out  You research exercises  you buy gym clothes and you even get a gym membership  Yet you never actually show up  You end up watching TV or playing video games because  well  you can  If you decide to skip the gym for the tenth time  you're not affecting anyone but yourself  There's no one there to hold you accountable  You should use reliability to motivate yourself to do things that you normally wouldn't  So the next time you plan on going to the gym  ask one of your friends to meet you there  That way someone else will be counting on you to show up  They'll expect you to follow through  so if you don't you won't get off scot-free like you did before  Reliability is effective for a number of reasons  but trust is a big one  You show up because you don't want to blow off your friend  You invited them to the gym so you can't just bail13 because you're feeling lazy  Sitting around watching Netflix is a pretty terrible reason to damage a friendship  Reliability also motivates you because you want your friend to think highly of you  You want them to see you as someone who takes their goals seriously  So when you're on your own it's easier to fail because no one has to know about it  Your friends and family won't have a different opinion of you if you don't go  But now your friend will see firsthand whether you're following through or not  So you show up to make sure you leave a good impression  For the same reason you're more likely to actually try while you're there  You can't just leave after five minutes or sit on your phone the whole time  Sitting there watching your friend do what they're supposed to do will motivate you to follow suit  Finally  reliability can make things more fun  It gives you someone to talk to which relieves anxiety and stress  Your friend might also be more experienced so they can help you get the most out of whatever you're doing  If you're struggling to find motivation on your own  hey  there's no shame in calling for backup  The simple fact that someone else is involved will jumpstart your work ethic15

	Number four  undermine your fears 
	  ，    。
	 
	Sometimes our laziness isn't really laziness  You might procrastinate16 or avoid doing something because well you're worried about what will happen when you try  You might have set your expectations way too high  You might feel an overwhelming amount of pressure to succeed  This can make even the smallest chores feel like huge responsibilities  You end up running away because you can't fail at something that you never actually do  Now to avoid this kind of laziness  check your expectations at the door  In other words  when you start a project  you only have one job and that's to start  Don't be afraid of making something terrible  just begin working on the first thing that pops into your mind  This gets you past that initial roadblock  Every project is way less intimidating17 when you're already halfway18 done  This is the same reason that teachers encourage their students to write rough drafts  You make something rough and imperfect to get an idea of where you're headed  Yeah it won't be very good because it's not supposed to be  There aren't any expectations or pressure  but you'll find that things seem a lot more doable afterwards  So when you're feeling lazy  don't be afraid to get a little messy  Improving something bad's a whole lot easier than making something perfect from scratch

	Number five  dress for productivity 
	  ，        。
	 
	Where are you the laziest  Well if you're like most people you probably feel lethargic19 whenever you're trying to work or study in your room  And your clothes maybe the biggest reason why  Now everyone knows it's a whole lot more comfortable to work in sweatpants or pajamas20  If you're gonna spend all day doing something that you don't want to  you might as well be comfy  right  The truth is your clothes can directly affect your habits  This is one of the biggest reasons why so many companies make their employees dress up for work  even if they aren't interacting with customers  Your brain naturally associates your habits with your environment  Think about studying in your room versus21 studying in the library  the latter is way more efficient  because your brain doesn't see your room as a workspace  So when you're in your room  your brain unconsciously thinks about relaxation22 and sleep  because that's what it's used to doing  But the library puts you in a different mental space  this new environment primes your brain to work and think harder than it would anywhere else  Clothes work the exact same way  What are you usually doing when you wear sweatpants  Chances are you aren't taking tests or going to meetings  you're probably playing video games or watching TV  So that's what your brain thinks about when you're wearing them  The lazier your clothes are  the lazier you'll feel  To overcome this kind of laziness  change into clothes that help you focus  Don't worry  you don't have to wear a suit and tie  You should choose something you wouldn't mind wearing out into the world  This is an especially helpful tip for students and people who work from home  Yeah it's tempting23 to lounge around all day in your comfiest outfit24  but you need to tell your brain when it's time to shift gears  A change of clothing is an easy and effective way to do just that
