The night is beautiful  So the faces of my people  The stars are beautiful  So the eyes of my people  Beautiful also is the sun  Beautiful also are the souls of my people  not a knocker; a pusher not a kicker; a motor not a clog1  To base my expectations of reward on a solid foundation of service rendered; to be willing to pay the price of success in honest effort To look upon my work as opportunity to be seized with joy and made the most of and not as painful drudgery2 to be reluctantly endured  To remember that success lies within myself; in my own brain my own ambition my own courage and determination To expect difficulties and force my way through them to turn hard experiences into capital for future struggles  To interest my heart and soul in my work and aspire3 to the highest efficiency in the achievement of results To be patiently receptive of just criticism and profit from its teaching To treat equals and superiors with respect and subordinates with kindly4 encouragement  To make a study of my business duties; to know my work from the ground up To mix brains with my efforts and use system and method in all I undertake To find time to do everything needful by never letting time find me or my subordinates doing nothing To hoard5 days as a miser6 does dollars to make every hour bring me dividends7 in specific results accomplished8 To steer9 clear of dissipation and guard my health of body and peace of mind as my most precious stock in trade  Finally to take a good grip on the joy of life; to play the game like a gentleman; to fight against nothing so hard as my own weakness and endeavor to grow in business capacity and as a man with the passage of every day of time mes to pass  and of the darkened elms od" old age in America  with satisfying final years and a dignified9 death  Unfortunately   none too good  For many elderly Americans old age is a tragedy  a period of quiet despair  deprivation10   desolation and muted rage  This can be a consequence of the kind of life a person has led in younger years and the problems in his or her relationships with others  There are also inevitable11 personal and physical losses to be sustained  some of which can become overwhelming and unbearable12  All of this is the individual factor  the existential element  But old age is frequently a tragedy even when the early years have been fulfilling and people seemingly have everything going for them  Herein lies what I consider to be the genuine tragedy of old age in America -- we have shaped a society which is extremely harsh to live in when one is old  The tragedy of old age is not the fact that each of us must grow old and die but that the process of doing so has been made unnecessarily and at times excruciatingly painful  humiliating  debilitating13 and isolating14 through insensitivity  ignorance and poverty  The potentials for satisfactions and even triumphs in late life are real and vastly under explored  For the most part the elderly struggle to exist in an inhospitable world
