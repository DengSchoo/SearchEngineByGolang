Do you have any tattoos2 I dont Ive never been brave enough to go under the needle But if you do have one you are not alone According to a report by Experian the number of tattoo1 parlours in Britain increased by 173 between 2004 and 2014 Tattoos have always been controversial personally and culturally Some people love them and some hate them So are they good or bad These days one in five people in the UK has some ink whether its a commemorative date a sleeve or a full body suit Whats responsible for this rise in popularity You see a lot of celebrities3 getting tattooed4 says Lee Clements of the British Tattoo Artist Association speaking on BBC radio As a result people want to copy them or it becomes a fashion thing certain tattoos become a trend Employers have become more accepting of visible tats too Last year Londons Metropolitan5 Police relaxed a ban on recruiting candidates with visible body art And earlier this year Air New Zealand said it would end a ban on body art to allow workers to express their individuality and cultural heritage That said not all employers would agree Grace 28 told the BBC that she had been offered jobs in sales which were then withdrawn6 when employers saw her hand tattoo It feels like having a tattoo is not socially acceptable she says Having a tattoo does not amount to a protected characteristic remarks Susan Harris legal director at the GMB union a UK trade union This means a person can be dismissed for having one if it breaches7 the employers dress code except on religious grounds And lets not forget the risk of infection At present anyone in the UK can set up a parlour and offer procedures without proper training a report from the Royal Society for Public Health says They note that just under 20 of those tattooed experience negative side effects including swelling8 burning or a skin infection It seems that attitudes to tattoos are changing but they arent quite there yet Should you be persuaded to have one visit a reputable tattoo artist with a portfolio9 Discuss your design with them and dont make a hasty decision If you later regret it your tattoo will need laser removal or a cover up Better get a temporary tattoo or henna tattoo first and see if youre happy with it Wear it for a few months and then decide  Wear it for a few months and then decide cide e trumpet-shaped blue flowers of morning glories climbing half way up a dilapidated wall  and an intense feeling of autumn will of itself well up inside you  As to morning glories  I like their blue or white flowers best  dark purple ones second best  and pink ones third best  It will be most desirable to have them set off by some tall thin grass planted underneath22 here and there

	Locust trees in the North  as a decorative23 embellishment of nature  also associate us with autumn  On getting up early in the morning  you will find the ground strewn all over with flower-like pistils fallen from locust trees  Quiet and smell-less  they feel tiny and soft underfoot

	After a street cleaner has done the sweeping24 under the shade of the trees  you will discover countless25 lines left by his broom in the dust  which look so fine and quiet that somehow a feeling of forlornness will begin to creep up on you  The same depth of implication is found in the ancient saying that a single fallen leaf from the wutong tree is more than enough to inform the world of autumn's presence

	The sporadic26 feeble chirping of cicadas is especially characteristic of autumn in the North  Due to the abundance of trees and the low altitude of dwellings27 in Peiping  cicadas are audible in every nook and cranny of the city  In the South  however  one cannot hear them unless in suburbs or hills  Because of their ubiquitous shrill28 noise  these insects in Peiping seem to be living off every household like crickets or mice

	As for autumn rains in the North  they also seem to differ from those in the South  being more appealing  more temperate29

	A sudden gust30 of cool wind under the slaty31 sky  and raindrops will start pitter-pattering  Soon when the rain is over  the clouds begin gradually to roll towards the west and the sun comes out in the blue sky  Some idle townsfolk  wearing lined or unlined clothing made of thick cloth  will come out pipe in mouth and  loitering under a tree by the end of a bridge  exchange leisurely conversation with acquaintances with a slight touch of regret at the passing of time:
	 
	“ ，     ——”“    ？        ！”
	"Oh  real nice and cool—"
	"Sure  Getting cooler with each autumn shower "

	Fruit trees in the North also make a wonderful sight in autumn  Take jujube tree for example  They grow everywhere—around the corner of a house  at the foot of a wall  by the side of a latrine or outside a kitchen door  It is at the height of autumn that jujubes  shaped like dates or pigeon eggs  make their appearance in a light yellowish-green amongst tiny elliptic leaves  By the time when they have turned ruddy and the leaves fallen  the north-westerly wind will begin to reign32 supreme33 and make a dusty world of the North  Only at the turn of July and August when jujubes  persimmons  grapes are 80-90 percent ripe will the North have the best of autumn—the golden days in a year

	Some literary critics say that Chinese literati  especially poets  are mostly disposed to be decadent34  which accounts for predominance of Chinese works singing the praises of autumn  Well  the same is true of foreign poets  isn't it  I haven't read much of foreign poetry and prose  nor do I want to enumerate35 autumn-related poems and essays in foreign literature  But  if you browse36 through collected works of English  German  French or Italian poets  or various countries' anthologies of poetry or prose  you can always comes across a great many literary pieces eulogizing or lamenting37 autumn  Long pastoral poems or songs about the four seasons by renowned38 poets are mostly distinguished39 by beautiful moving lines on autumn  All that goes to show that all live creatures and sensitive humans alike are prone40 to the feeling of depth  remoteness  severity and bleakness41

	Not only poets  even convicts in prison  I suppose  have deep sentiments in autumn in spite of themselves  Autumn treats all humans alike  regardless of nationality  race or class  However  judging from Chinese idiom qiushi (autumn scholar  meaning and aged42 scholar grieving over frustrations43 in his life) and frequent selection in textbooks of Ouyang Xiu's On the Autumn Sough and Su Dongpo's On the Red Cliff  Chinese men of letters seem to be particularly autumn-minded  But  to know the real flavour of autumn  especially China's autumn  one has to visit the North

	Autumn in the South also has its unique features  such as the moonlit Ershisi Bridge in Yangzhou  the flowing sea tide at the Qiantangjiang River  the mist-shrouded Putuo Mountain and lotuses at the Lizhiwan Bay  But they all lack strong colour and lingering flavour  Southern autumn is to Northern autumn what yellow rice wine is to kaoliang wine  congee44 to steamed buns  perches45 to crabs46  yellow dogs to camels

	Autumn  I mean Northern autumn  if only it could be made to last forever  I would be more than willing to keep but one-third of my life-span and have two-thirds of it bartered47 for the prolonged stay of the season
