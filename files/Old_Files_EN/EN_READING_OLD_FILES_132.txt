The perpetual struggle for each of us is finding more time to read Even for voracious1 readers downtime with a good book can be elusive2 Speed reading is certainly one way to read more books because it helps you read each book in less time I have tried it myself; personally I do not retain the information nearly as well and it feels more like a cheap hack3 than a veritable method to learning more and reading more Reading goals like one book per week or 20 books per year help set the bar and provide an aim for you to move towards in a productive manner; yet the stepbystep path of achieving a reading goal can often prove trying Some years ago I made it a goal to read one book per week 52 books in a year And I failed That first year I tried to read a book per week I only made it to around 30 total books To instill more regular reading in my life I did two things which have since helped me surpass upwards4 of 60 books per year multiple years in a row now With implementing5 these two techniques reading more books becomes automatic and a natural unavoidable consequence Read at the Same Time Every DaySetting a time frame specifically reserved for reading each and every day is the single best thing to do to read more books This creates a nonnegotiable block of time which you can use to incrementally6 hack away at your reading goals for the week month and year; it provides the opportunity to read productively Without scheduling regular reading time in achieving reading goals is more difficult Building this time block for reading will make reading a habit such that it no longer becomes something you need to think about plan or worry over The time block becomes a habit and the habit is what automates7 reading into your life as an inextricable piece to who you are and what you do Reading at the same time each and every day further ensures that you have no excuses to intrude8 upon your reading goals Make that time sacred and untouchable schedule meetings and social outings before or after that time block but give priority to your allotted9 reading time For myself I read first thing for one hour in the morning every single morning no intrusions no interruptions no exceptions This allows me to read around one book per week Consider the math: a book of around 200300 pages takes about 57 hours to read on average depending on reading speed Blocking out one hour per day immediately puts you at one book per week for a typicalsized book at a typical reading speed Start Listening to AudiobooksBefore I started listening to audiobooks I was reading about one book per week and 52 books per year About two years ago I implemented10 audiobooks that put me at around 65 books per year I dont listen to audiobooks that much or that often Usually I listen to one maybe two in a month But that makes a difference of 10 to 15 books over the course of a year When Im walking or driving I can fit in extra reading time by listening to an audiobook instead of radio or music When Im working out in the gym or going for a run I can squeeze in a few chapters Or even when Im cooking I can throw on an audiobook Each of us have a lot more time in the day than we realize but that time can often get frittered away if used without intention Audiobooks are a means of using time more intentionally11 and in a manner conducive12 to a reading goal They fill in the downtime with books and reading Most audiobooks are between 6 and 10 hours long some of them push upwards of 12 to 15 But even for longer books the total time is negligible when spread across weeks or months Consider the math once again: If you have a thirtyminute commute13 to work each way that is potentially an hour per day to listen to a book Or if you only want to listen in the morning for example thirty minutes of extra reading per day remains14 excellent you could get through nearly two 8hour audiobooks per month at thirty minutes a day I would be remiss15 to ignore the small faction16 of readers who do not count audiobooks as reading So here is me addressing them Personally I do count audiobooks as reading a book read aloud is still a book By implementing a regular time block for reading each day reading turns into a habit and becomes automated17 Thinking about when you can fit in time to read no longer applies once it becomes a routine part of your day Soon enough it becomes an integral piece of your identity as well you see yourself as a reader and so do others which further motivates and compounds the habit of reading Next try out an audiobook Give yourself a month to listen to one book youll realize that you fly through the book much quicker than this Its a fun and leisurely18 way of reading more books And who doesnt like being read to by someone else With these two ideas you and me and everyone else can actually read more books  two ideas you and me and everyone else can actually read more books  books   。                ：“         ？”      ----“     ？”         ，        。

	We need someone to be there for us when we are tired and want to give up  Whenever we realize that there is someone we miss so much deep inside  take a deep breath and carry on for I believe there is always a shelter for my soul  So there are plenty of strong –minded people who are brave enough to fight for love once more time  no matter what they met before or how heart-broken they were  All the seeking is for happiness  See  among all these people  we are able to find each other

	For this time  I strongly believe that there will be the one who keeps searching for us from dawn to dusk To you  please believe that we must reunite in the future  even if I forget your name  One thing is certain  If we see each other  we will know
