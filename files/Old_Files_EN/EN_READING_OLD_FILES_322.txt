They don't talk as much as you because they know they got smart by listening  They know lots of things other than what they're specialized1 in Theirs is the gift of a broad mind constantly fed with the stimulant2 of being interested in what everyone else is doing   They juggle3 home work and personal interests with dexterity4 and never fall back on the tired old refrain about "work life balance" And when they're juggling5 they somehow manage to seem 100% engaged with what they're doing on all fronts simultaneously6 even though you know they're taking appropriate steps behind the scenes to make sure their lives are perfectly7 serenely8 balanced  They probably do social media Not always but probably It is not only another chance to listen but one they use to ensure they can feed their brains with things they otherwise wouldn't have come across  Even when things go very badly wrong they'll be smiling Smart people never get ruffled9 because their smart brains present them with alternatives faster than the bad stuff can happen  They know they are usually the smartest person in the room but they don't spend their time dwelling10 on that Instead they take it as a personal challenge to see if they can make everyone else the smartest person in the room too  If they are managers they will make every effort to get people smarter more connected and more popular than them in their teams They're not threatened because they know that smartness is synergistic They also make sure that their smart people get to look smarter than them for the same reason  They have hidden skills that never get rolled out until they're needed They don't have any need to show their full capabilities11 for reasons of proving they're better than others  They may or may not have expensive educations You'd never know just by being with them unless you had their CV in front of you  They never ever under any circumstances make you look stupid even though it would be easy to do so They've learnt through bitter experience that the only thing that happens when you make someone look bad is you look bad yourself going to the movies today " We didn't hear her right  "What " we objected "What do you mean Aren't we going to The Matinee Mommy you said that we are going to the Matinee " Mother stooped9 and gathered us in her arms I couldn't understand why there were tears in her eyes We still had the time to get the bus but hugging us she gently explained this is a fib felt like "It is important that what we say is true " Mom said "I fibbed to you just now and it felt awful to me I don't ever want to fib again and I'm sure you don't want to fib again either People must be able to believe each others Do you understand " We assured10 her that we understood We would never forget And since we had learned a lesson why not go to the movie to see The Matinee There were still time Not today Mother told us We would go another time That is how over fifty years ago my sister and I learned to be truthful We have never forgotten how much a fib can be hurt
