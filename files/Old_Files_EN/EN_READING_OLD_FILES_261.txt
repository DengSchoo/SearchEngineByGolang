To a large degree the measure of our peace of mind is determined1 by how much we are able to live in the present moment Irrespective of what happened yesterday or last year and what may or may not happen tomorrow the present moment is where you are -- always  Without question many of us have mastered the neurotic2 art of spending much of our lives worrying about a variety of things -- all at once We allow past problems and future concerns to dominate our present moments so much so that we end up anxious frustrated3 depressed4 and hopeless  On the flip5 side we also postpone6 our gratification our stated priorities and our happiness often convincing ourselves that 'someday' will be better than today Unfortunately the same mental dynamics7 that tell us to look toward the future will only repeat themselves so that "someday" never actually arrives  John Lennon once said 'Life is what's happening while we're busy making other plans 'When we're busy making 'other plans' our children are busy growing up the people we love are moving away and dying our bodies are getting out of shape and our dreams are slipping away In short we miss out on life  Many people live as if life were a dress rehearsal8 for some later date It isn't In fact no one has a guarantee that he or she will be here tomorrow Now is the only time we have and the only time that we have any control over When our attention is in the present moment we push fear from our minds Fear is the concern over events that might happen in the future -- we won' t have enough money our children will get into trouble we will get old and die whatever  To combat fear the best strategy is to learn to bring your attention back to the present Mark Twain said 'I have been through some terrible things in my life some of which actually happened I don't think I can say it any better Practice keeping your attention on the here and now Your efforts will pay great dividends9  n let's just walk " Looking at her  I noticed the delicate fairness	 	of her face  "Where do you live " I asked 	 	"Over there " She pointed15 toward a row of summer cottages  Strange  I thought  in winter 	 	"Where do you go to school "	 	"I don't go to school  Mommy says we're on vacation " She chattered16 little girl talk as we strolled up the beach  but my mind was on other things  When I left for home  Wendy said it had been a happy day 	 	Feeling surprisingly better  I smiled at her and agreed  Three weeks later  I rushed to my beach in a state of near panic  I was in no mood to even greet Wendy  I thought I saw her mother on the porch and felt like demanding she keep her child at home 	 	"Look  if you don't mind " I said crossly when Wendy caught up with me  "I'd rather be alone today "	 	She seems unusually pale and out of breath 	 	"Why " she asked 	 	I turned to her and shouted  "Because my mother died " and thought  my God  why was I saying this to a little child 	 	"Oh " she said quietly  "then this is a bad day "	 	"Yes  and yesterday and the day before and-oh  go away "	 	"Did it hurt  "	 	"Did what hurt " I was exasperated17 with her  with myself 	 	"When she died " "Of course it hurt " I snapped  misunderstanding  wrapped up in myself  I strode off 	 	A month or so after that  when I next went to the beach  she wasn't there  Feeling guilty  ashamed and admitting to myself I missed her  I went up to the cottage after my walk and knocked at the door  A drawn18 looking young woman with honey-colored hair opened the door #p#    #e#	 	"Hello " I said  "I'm Ruth Peterson  I missed your little girl today and wondered where she was "	 	"Oh yes  Mrs  Peterson  please come in" "Wendy talked of you so much 	 	I'm afraid I allowed her to bother you  If she was a nuisance  please  accept my apologies "	 	"Not at all-she's a delightful19 child " I said  suddenly realizing that I meant it  "Where is she "	 	"Wendy died last week  Mrs  Peterson  She had leukemia  Maybe she didn't tell you " Struck dumb  I groped for a chair  My breath caught 	 	"She loved this beach; so when she asked to come  we couldn't say no 	 	She seemed so much better here and had a lot of what she called happy days  But the last few weeks  she declined rapidly   " her voice faltered20 	 	"She left something for you   if only I can find it  Could you wait a moment while I look "	 	I nodded stupidly  my mind racing21 for something  anything  to say to this lovely young woman  She handed me a smeared22 envelope  with MRS  P printed in bold  childish letters  Inside was a drawing in bright crayon hues-a yellow beach  a blue sea  and a brown bird  Underneath23 was carefully printed: A SANDPIPER TO BRING YOU JOY	 	Tears welled up in my eyes  and a heart that had almost forgotten to love opened wide  I took Wendy's mother in my arms  "I'm so sorry  I'm sorry  I'm so sorry " I muttered over and over  and we wept together 	 	The precious little picture is framed now and hangs in my study  Six words- one for each year of her life- that speak to me of harmony  courage  undemanding love  A gift from a child with sea-blue eyes and hair the color sand--- who taught me the gift of love
