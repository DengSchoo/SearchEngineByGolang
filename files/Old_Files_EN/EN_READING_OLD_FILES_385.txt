If it was going to be easy it never would have started with something called labor1  Shouting to make your children obey is like using the horn to steer2 your car and you get about the same results  To be in your children's memories tomorrow you have to be in their lives today  The smartest advice on raising children is to enjoy them while they are still on your side  The best way to keep kids at home is to give it a loving atmosphere - and hide the keys to the car  The right temperature in a home is maintained by warm hearts not by hot heads  Parents: People who bare infants bore teenagers and board newlyweds  The joy of motherhood: What a woman experiences when all the children are finally in bed  Lifes golden age is when the kids are too old to need baby-sitters and too young to borrow the family car  Grandparents are similar to a piece of string - handy to have around and easily wrapped around the fingers of grandchildren  A child outgrows3 your lap but never outgrows your heart  God gave you two ears and one mouth  so you should listen twice as much as you talk  There are three ways to get something done: Do it yourself hire someone to do it or forbid your children to do it  Adolescence4 is the age when children try to bring up their parents  Cleaning your house while your kids are at home is like trying to shovel5 the driveway during a snowstorm  Oh to be only half as wonderful as my child thought I was when he was small and half as stupid as my teenager now thinks I am  There are only two things a child will share willingly: communicable diseases and his mothers age  Money isn't everything but it sure keeps the kids in touch  Adolescence is the age at which children stop asking questions because they know all the answers  A alarm clock is a device for awakening6 people who don't have small children  No wonder kids are confused today Half the adults tell them to find themselves; the other half tell them to get lost  People hardest to convince that it's time for retirement7 are children at bedtime  Kids really brighten a household; they never turn off any lights  kaging" to be different  What may appear as bad fortune may in fact be the door that is just waiting to be opened
