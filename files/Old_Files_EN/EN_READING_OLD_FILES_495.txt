Although we would all love to be Ms Popular at home and in the office at work the task is not to be liked but to be effective says computer sales executive Andrea  "This is possibly the single most important lesson we can learn You can't always be popular You shouldn't have to be; it's not what you're there for Progress depends on having your own ideas and sticking to them And that means having the guts1 to make difficult decisions when you have to " she says  We're aware from day one in our first job that every decision we make is either a building block or a stumbling block on our career path We should use the time to lay the groundwork of future respect by being professional responsible innovative2 diligent3 and reliable  Respect is never given for nothing Claire knew that she was offered a move to Paris with her finance company because she had gained a reputation for keeping cool under fire And the next step up the ladder would depend on her performance in Paris  "It's essential to build regard if you're going to be able to do what you want in your job " she says Winning respect enhances all you do A proposal for change is more likely to be well received; an application for a raise or a request for promotion4 is more likely to succeed ists that you cannot get happiness by pursuing it  This is only true if you pursue it unwisely  Gamblers at Monte Carlo are pursuing money  and most of them lose it instead  but there are other ways of pursuing money  which often succeed  So it is with happiness  If you pursue it by means of drink  you are forgetting the hang-over  Epicurus pursued it by living only in congenial society and eating only dry bread  supplemented by a little cheese on feast days  His method proved successful in his case  but he was a valetudinarian  and most people would need something more vigorous  For most people  the pursuit of happiness  unless supplemented in various ways  is too abstract and theoretical to be adequate as a personal rule of life  But I think that whatever personal rule of life you may choose it should not  except in rare and heroic cases  be incompatible with happiness  Man is an animal  and his happiness depends on his physiology more than he likes to think  This is a humble conclusion  but I cannot make myself disbelieve it  Unhappy businessmen  I am convinced  would increase their happiness more by walking six miles every day than by any conceivable change of philosophy
