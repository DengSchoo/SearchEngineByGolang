Everyone would have heard the famous phrase "Anger is one short of danger" It is an age-old adage1 but it is tested and still holds ture Thing said or done during anger have created havoc2 with a lot of people and things the tightly packed bag of mental frustation erupts into a volcano of anger  But basically lets try to analyse why oue gets angry When one is not satisfied with the way things have gone when someone has been taken in for a ride when one blames life for treating him badly and many such trivial things are the various reasons All the frustrations3 get collected on one part of our mind and when we can bear it no longer our feelings are vented4 in the form of a volcano of emotional tantrums Anger is one of the major handrances in self-development because it narrows our outlook The mind looses its sense of logic5 and fairness when it is accelerated by the arrogant6 mood of anger  Getting angry can get your things done somewhere but not everywhere This is because as you grow you yourself are responsible to clean your recycle bin7 of emotions and frustrations No one has the foresight8 or capacity to judge what has bought you to that violent mood or what hardships you have faced Angry people hardly go places The closer one comes to this piece of reality the better he will get  The best way to counterattack anger is to imbile patience in ourselves A person with infinite patience has matured mentally and is the bravest war-horse over the path of anger He controlled himself everytime and got away from trying circumstances using the best lifeline available Such people are always in peace with themselves and are always enjoying life  Anger is never good and it increases anxiety levels of the individual When one is angry the heart pumps a lot more blood than the normal capacity and hence it leads to high blood pressure This may also cause a heart attack So always be like the hard working duck which is calm and composed by ites expressions but padding like the hell at the bottom For human beings this means that we have to keep moving in life by hard work Never let disappointment and frustrations rule you You make your own future and destiny by following the right attitude  After all it's all in a state of mind Everyone has two opyions One is anger and the other is maintaining your composure through pacience I choose the latter one What have you chosen  enjoy each season  each change  We often teased him about his life history  He had written two paragraphs summarizing fifty years of work  and a full nine pages about every trip and vacation he'd ever taken  In July  Grandpa worsened  One hot afternoon arrived when no one else was at his bedside  He was glad to have me there  and reached out his hand to pull me close  I told Grandpa what I had learned -- that few flowers last from April to November  Some of the most beautiful bloom for only a month at most  To really enjoy a garden  you have to plant corners and drifts and rows of flowers that will bloom and grace the garden  each in its own season  His eyes listened to every word  Then  another discovery: "If I want a garden like yours  Grandpa  I'm going to have to work " His grin laughed at me  and his eyes teased me  "Grandpa  in your life right now the chrysanthemums5 are in bloom  Chrysanthemums and roses " Tears clouded both our eyes  Neither of us feared this last flower of fall  but the wait for spring seems longest in November  We knew how much we would miss each other  Sitting there  I suddenly felt that the best gift I could give Grandpa would be to give voice to the testimony6 inside both of us  He had never spoken of his testimony to me  but it was such a part of his life that I had never questioned if Grandpa knew  I knew he knew  "Grandpa " I began -- and his grip tightened7 as if he knew what I was going to say -- "I want you to know that I have a testimony  I know the Savior lives  I bear witness to you that Joseph Smith is a prophet  I love the Restoration and joy in it " The steadiness in Grandpa's eyes told how much he felt it too  "I bear witness that President Kimball is a prophet  I know the Book of Mormon is true  Grandpa  Every part of me bears this witness " "Grandpa " I added quietly  "I know our Father in Heaven loves you " Unbidden  unexpected  the Spirit bore comforting  poignant8 testimony to me of our Father's love for my humble  quiet Grandpa  A tangible9 sense of Heavenly Father's compassionate10 awareness of Grandpa's suffering surrounded us and held us  It was so personal and powerful that no words were left to me -- only tears of gratitude11 and humility12  tears of comfort  Grandpa and I wept together  It was the end of August when Grandpa died  the end of summer  As we were choosing flowers from the florist13 for Grandpa's funeral  I slipped away to Grandpa's garden and walked with my memories of columbine and Sweet William  Only the tall lavender and white phlox were in bloom now  and some baby's breath in another corner  On impulse  I cut the prettiest strands14 of phlox and baby's breath and made one more arrangement for the funeral  When they saw it  friends and family all smiled to see Grandpa's flowers there  We all felt how much Grandpa would have liked that  The October after Grandpa's death  I planted tulip and daffodil bulbs  snowdrops  crocuses  and bluebells15  Each bulb was a comfort to me  a love sent to Grandpa  a promise of spring
