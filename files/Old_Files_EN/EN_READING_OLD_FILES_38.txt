Lets be honest Im sure weve all done something a little dishonest in our lives maybe copying someones work borrowing some money from a friend and not paying them back or being given too much change in a shop and keeping quiet about it Or maybe Im wrong maybe youre a good upstanding citizen who believes that honesty is the best policy This proverb honesty is the best policy was written back in the 1700s by American statesman Benjamin Franklin We may agree that owning up to our mistakes and behaving in a genuine and decent way is the right way to lead our lives but is there something in our human nature that makes us unscrupulous For example in some shops and car parks you can find an honesty box a box where you pay for something by putting money in it but it relies on you putting the right amount of cash in This relies on people being honest and not trying to cheat but it does provide a temptation to get away with not paying the full amount Philip Graves a psychologist and author of the book Consumerology suggests that this temptation is part of our evolution He says: We have evolved with the capacity to be dishonest Its part of our evolutionary1 psychological make up because if we can gain an advantage over the people around us we have a greater chance of surviving So why do we place such importance on being honest if we benefit from being dishonest Its because it is selfish behaviour which other members of our social group wont like If everybody acted selfishly and dishonestly all the time the world would be a very unpleasant place As Philip Graves says: There is a balance to strike between the extent to which we can feather our own nest so to speak and the risk of being ostracised by the group So for societies to work together we need to trust each other and therefore we need to be honest Being trustworthy with money is of course crucial for an economy to survive and there are laws to protect us from dishonest practices like corruption2 and fraud But being honest with words is another matter; saying what we think to someone can get us into hot water However a new anonymous3 messaging app has been designed that lets anyone with a link to your profile to send you a message without knowing who its from The app now has 300 million users which perhaps indicates how honest we really like to be but in all honesty do you want to know what people think about you Is honesty always the best policy you Is honesty always the best policy policy 	Â 	Disclaimer: Your mind will try to tell you that there's no need to write everything BUT YOU HAVE TO 	 her own: a tiny, sweet miracle.
