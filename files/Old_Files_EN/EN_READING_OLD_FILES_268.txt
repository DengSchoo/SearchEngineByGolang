I've learned that sometimes all a person need is a hand to hold and a heart to understand  I've learned that the Lord didn't do it all in one day What makes me think I can  I've learned that love not time heals all wounds  I've learned that every one you meet deserves to be greeted with a smile  I've learned that there's nothing sweeter than sleeping with your babies and feeling their breath on your cheeks  I've learned that on one is perfect until you fall in love with them  I've learned that opportunities are never lost; someone will take the ones you miss  I've learned that when you harbor bitterness happiness will dock elsewhere  I've learned that I wish I could have told my Mom that I love her one more time before she passed away  I've learned that one should keep his words both soft and tender because tomorrow he may have ti eat them  I've learned that a smile is an inexpensive way to improve your looks   I've learned that I can't choose how I feel but I can choose what I do about it  I've learned that everyone wants to stand on top of the mountain but all the happiness and growth occurs while you're climbing it  I've learned that it is best to give advice in only two circumstances :when it is requested and when it is a life-threatening situation  I've learned that the less time I have to work with the more things I get done e and be glad to see him  Some Don'ts: Don't greet him with problems and complaints Don't complain if he is late for dinner Count this as minor6 compared to what he might have gone through that day Make him comfortable Have him lean back in a comfortable chair or suggest that he lie down in the bedroom Have a cool drink ready for him Arrange his pillow and offer to take off his shoes Speak in a low soft soothing7 and pleasant voice Allow him to relax and unwind  Listen to him You may have a dozen things to tell him but the moment of his arrival is not the time Let him talk first  Make the evening his Never complain if he does not take you out to dinner or other pleasant entertainment Instead try to understand his world of strain and pressure his need to unwind and relax  The goal Try to make your home a place of peace and order where your husband can relax in body and spirit  to call Layton a genius " Elizabeth has rediscovered her enthusiasm 	 	We can't afford to waste tears on "might-have-beens " We need to turn the tears into sweat as we go after "what-can-be "	 	We need to live each moment wholeheartedly  with all our senses -- finding pleasure in the fragrance13 of a back-yard garden  the crayoned picture of a six-year-old  the enchanting14 beauty of a rainbow  It is such enthusiastic love of life that puts a sparkle in our eyes  a lilt in our steps and smooths the wrinkles from our souls
