Welcome to Faith Radio Online-Simply to Relax I'm Faith This is my first radio show; first of all I would like to thank you for clicking and entering into my radio program  Today let us share the key to living a life of love  The key to living a life of love peace and prosperity is to live from your Heart  When you live from your Heart you feel full rich and life seems to flow effortlessly You feel in control confident connected to your life's purpose You feel Joy and deep inner Peace You feel Alive  When love radiates from your Heart you feel vibrant1 energized2 and blissful The feeling of being on purpose inspires you to new heights  some you never dreamed possible  Living from Your Heart keeps you focused on what is most important to you in your life You move from focusing on conflict to re-focusing on what is most important to you Your Deepest Heart's Desires  In your Heart holds the Secret to true happiness The Secret is Love Love is the tender expression of the Heart  an expression we all long to feel deep within ersity friends seemed happy in corporate4 jobs that made me miserable5  I felt constant pressure to fit a specific mold  It's only within the past year that I've started to come to terms with who I really am and what really makes me happy  Life is not one-size-fits-all  Choose the career and lifestyle that are true to you  not a version of that you wish you were 
Learn to live within your means  Learn smart financial management now  Learn how to live within a budget and maintain good credit  A mistake I once made  and one I still see a number of my peers making  is being a slave to lifestyle: taking cabs everywhere  buying expensive clothing  and having meals out constantly  This is stupid and reckless  I know people who were left completely adrift despite having made great salaries because they had no savings6 when their careers hit a rough patch  Their income was spent all on things that are frivolous7  Luxuries are a wonderful thing only if you can truly afford them  Don't be a slave to funding a lifestyle that will not last  Learn to live modestly and save up  and then you will have earned the right to purchase yourself some treats  in moderation 
Choose who you spend your time with carefully  Time is a precious commodity and you start to realize that increasingly into your mid8 to late twenties  Choose your friends wisely  Separate yourself from toxic9 or negative influences  those who would waste your time  and those who encourage you to focus on the unimportant  Seek out people who give you happiness  who inspire you  who support you  and nourish those relationships instead
