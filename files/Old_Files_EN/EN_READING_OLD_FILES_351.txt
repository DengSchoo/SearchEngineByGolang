I was six years old my sister Sally Kay was a submissive three-year-old girl For some reasons I thought we needed to earn  some money I decided1 we should "hire out" as maids We visited the neighbors offering to clean houses for them for a quater cents Reasonable as our offer was there were no takers But one neighbor telephoned my mother to let her know what Mary Alice and Sally Kay were doing  Mother had just hung up the phone when we came first into the back door into the kitchen of our apartement "Girls " mother asked "why were you two going around the neighborhood telling people you would clean their houses "  Mother wasn't angry with us In fact we learned2 afterwards she was amused that we had came up with such an idea  But for some reason we both denied having done any such thing Shocked and terribly hurt that her dear little girls could be such "boldfaced liars3" Mother then told us that Mrs Jones had just called and told her we had been to her house and said we would clean it for a quater cents  Faced with the truth we admitted what we had done Mother said we have fibed we have not told the truth  She was sure that we knew better She tried to explain why a fib hurt but she didn't feel that we really understood  Years later she told us that the lesson she came up with for trying to teach us to be truthful4 would probably have been found upon by child psychologists The idea came to her in a flash and a tender-hearted mother told us it was the most difficult lesson she ever taught us It was a lesson we never forgot After admonishing5 us mother cheerfully6 begain preparing for lunch As we monching on sandwhiches she asked:" Would you two like to go to see the movies this afternoon " "Wow would we ever " We wondered what movie would be playing Mother said:"The Matinee"  "Oh fatastic We would be going to see The Matinee would we lucky " We got bathed and all dressed up It was like getting ready for a birthday party We hurried outside the apartment not wanting to miss the bus that would take us downtown On the landing7 Mom stunned8 us by saying "Girls we are not going to the movies today " We didn't hear her right  "What " we objected "What do you mean Aren't we going to The Matinee Mommy you said that we are going to the Matinee " Mother stooped9 and gathered us in her arms I couldn't understand why there were tears in her eyes We still had the time to get the bus but hugging us she gently explained this is a fib felt like "It is important that what we say is true " Mom said "I fibbed to you just now and it felt awful to me I don't ever want to fib again and I'm sure you don't want to fib again either People must be able to believe each others Do you understand " We assured10 her that we understood We would never forget And since we had learned a lesson why not go to the movie to see The Matinee There were still time Not today Mother told us We would go another time That is how over fifty years ago my sister and I learned to be truthful We have never forgotten how much a fib can be hurt  teve's death out of my mind  It just doesn't seem fair  that he had to die at such a young age  I don't even know how I'm surviving  I don't even know how I'm going to survive  During evening the next day  there was a violent rumble13  and a big swooshing sound  I turned and looked through my binoculars14  There  in the distance  was a humongous tsunami15 headed my way  Boom  I jumped  I looked up to see the clouds darkening and the lightning illuminating16 the endless sky  "Great " I said  "just like salt can't go without pepper  tsunamis17 can't go without a storm " I returned my glance to the tsunami  and even though it was still far away  I was terrified of it  I took my paddle and started to move out of the tsunami's path  There it was again  the swooshing noise  I turned my glance towards to where the sound came from  There  dead ahead  was a monster wave taller than Harbor Center  and longer than a train  rushing in my direction  I just watched it  terrified of its massive size  its thundering noise  and  its rushing speed  Fortunately for me  the tsunami didn't crash until about 400 metres away from me  Unfortunately for me  the wave was so powerful that it created an abundance of smaller tsunamis  I was terrified as a tiny tsunami demolished18 my raft and sent me flying through the air  Splash  I landed in the freezing water  and saw nothing but tsunamis crashing and clashing together  I couldn't move  not because I was numb19  but because I was too scared  I couldn't even feel my body anymore  "Oh no " I thought  "I'm getting hypothermia  I'm going to die " I watched the tsunami thunder in my path  "Oh well " I thought  "at least I'll all my problems will go away when I die " Now the tsunami was only a kilometre away  and was coming closer with each passing second  "Good-bye world  good-bye life  good-bye Steve " I said as the tsunami was only a few seconds from tearing me apart #p#    #e# "Good-bye life  Try good-bye tsunami " shouted a voice from above  I looked up  There  in midair  was a chopper to rescue me  "Grab on " shouted the voice as he threw down a rope ladder  I quickly grabbed hold of it and just barely missed the tsunami  I looked down as I was being pulled up  Boom  The tsunami crashed in the spot where I was before  awaiting my death  But I realized that life was too good to give up  so I cheated death  by a hair  "where am I  And who are you " I asked in a weary voice  "You're home  and my name's Steve " said the voice  "What " That was I could say before I slumped20 into a deep sleep     "Joey  Joey " said a mysterious voice  I opened my eyes  "Joey  Joey " repeated the voice  I looked at my surroundings  and found out that I was in a hospital bed  and that I was not alone  I looked at my visitor  He had blue eyes  brown hair  a gaunt face  all of the features that Steve had  I gasped21  "Steve " I asked  "Yes " he replied  "But  you're- " "No  I didn't die " he replied  "But  how " "It doesn't matter now  but I'll tell you someday  The main priority for you is to get better " he said  "Don't worry  your parents will be here soon " I smiled and thought in my head  "So many good things happened in my life  and so many of them lost  But this adventure  I shall never forget " I took one last look around me  and then I closed my eyes
