Mistakes while learning  There will be times when you have people above you (a boss) or even next to you (a coworker) that will get really irritated with you for "ruining" something "crucial" Errors are bound to happen when you have on your training wheels Even if you make mistakes and get a slap on the wrist persevere1 and push on You do not need to be embarrassed for learning from your mistakes   Food choices  People are different and have different taste buds Whether it is healthy or not food is a choice and it is a part of life It is simply a personal choice that people make for their own reasons You do not need to be embarrassed for food you do or do not like Tell them "It is a personal choice I have made and I am committed to it "Your past  Allowing positive experiences to define confine refine and outshine you may cause you to be caught up in the past and unable to truly live in the present Whether your history is positive negative or somewhere in between don't hone in on the negative experiences and let it reflect your current behavior   The cleanliness of your car/home/work space  When everyone gets in the car you realize your Starbucks bag are still on the floor So what Think about it this way: everyone has a "messy" aspect of their life Maybe their home is spotless but the relationship with their spouse2 is messy Someone's car gets washed once a week but his/her work life could use some help No one on Earth lives a perfectly3 "clean" life in every aspect We don't apologize to others about our personal pitfalls4 By being outwardly embarrassed it only brings more attention to the fact   Putting yourself first  If you find yourself saying no to something or making up lies to get out of it tell them the truth and don't apologize You will feel much better in the long run if you are honest with them and yourself If you're not up to a voluntary obligation you don't have to be You can politely deny the person's request It is okay to be selfish from time to time Put yourself first ive unusual " We can take the "unusual" path and become truly unusual people Unusual people discover their purpose and live it each day  their purpose and live it each day Coworkers cornered me in the break room  "Guess you got to Jack " they said  "You must have told him off good " I shook my head  "Jack and I are becoming friends " I said in faith  I refused to talk about him  Every time I saw Jack in the hall  I smiled at him  After all  that's what friends do  One year after our "talk " I discovered I had breast cancer  I was thirty-two  the mother of three beautiful young children  and scared  The cancer had metastasized to my lymph nodes and the statistics were not great for long-term survival  After my surgery  friends and loved ones visited and tried to find the right words  No one knew what to say  and many said the wrong things  Others wept  and I tried to encourage them  I clung to hope myself  One day  Jack stood awkwardly in the doorway8 of my small  darkened hospital room  I waved him in with a smile  He walked over to my bed and without a word placed a bundle beside me  Inside the package lay several bulbs  "Tulips " he said  I grinned  not understanding  He shuffled9 his feet  then cleared his throat  "If you plant them when you get home  they'll come up next spring  I just wanted you to know that I think you'll be there to see them when they come up " Tears clouded my eyes and I reached out my hand  "Thank you " I whispered  Jack grasped my hand and gruffly replied  "You're welcome  You can't see it now  but next spring you'll see the colors I picked out for you  I think you'll like them " He turned and left without another word  For ten years  I have watched those red-and-white striped tulips push their way through the soil every spring  In a moment when I prayed for just the right word  a man with very few words said all the right things  After all  that's what friends do
