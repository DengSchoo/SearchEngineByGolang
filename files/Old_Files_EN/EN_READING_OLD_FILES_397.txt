I love and am used to keeping a distance with those changed things Only in this way can I know what will not be abandoned2 by time For example when you love someone changes are all around Then I step backward3 and watching it silently4 then I see the true feelings  Men love from overlooking5 while women love from looking up If love is a mountain then if men go up more women they will see while women will see fewer men  Good love makes you see the whole world from one person while bad love makes you abandon1 the whole world for one person  We shall always save a place for ourselves only for ourselves And then begin to love Have no idea of what it is who he is how to love or how long it will be Just wait for one love Maybe no one will come out but this kind of waiting is the love itself  Is there anyone who hasn't suffered for the secret love We always think that love is very heavy heavy and could be the heaviest thing in the world But one day when you look back you suddenly realize that it's always light light We all thought love was very deep but in fact it's very thin The deepest and heaviest love must grow up with the time  In this world only those men who really feel happy can give women happiness  ied will the world be with you ixed6 rules about the company he or she keeps must be observed  The subject should be uttermost in the thoughts  and canvassed7 often Companionship is education  good or not; it develops manhood or womanhood  high or low; it lifts soul upward or drags it downward; it minister to virtue or vice8  There is no half way work about its influence  If it ennobles  it does grandly  if it demoralizes  it doest it devilishly  It saves or destroys lustily  Nothing in the world is surer than this  Sow virtue  and the harvest will be virtue  Sow vice  and the harvest will be vice  Good companionships help us to sow virtue; evil companionships help us to sow vice big rocks in first or you'll never get them in at all "
