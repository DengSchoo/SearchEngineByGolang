Secret #11: They delegate almost everything  Ultra-productive people don't ask "How can I do this task " Instead they ask "How can this task get done " They take the "I" out of it as much as possible Ultra-productive people don't have control issues and they are not micro-managers In many cases good enough is well good enough  Secret #12: They theme days of the week  Highly successful people often theme days of the week to focus on major areas For decades I've used "Mondays for Meetings" and make sure I'm doing one-on-one check-ins with each direct report My Friday afternoons are themed around financials and general administrative1 items that I want to clean up before the new week starts I've previously2 written about Jack3 Dorsey's work themes which enable him to run two companies at once Batch4 your work to maximize your efficiency and effectiveness  Secret #13: They touch things only once  How many times have you opened a piece of regular mail -- a bill perhaps -- and then put it down only to deal with it again later How often do you read an email and then close it and leave it in your inbox to deal with later Highly successful people try to "touch it once " If it takes less than five or ten minutes -- whatever it is -- they'll deal with it right then and there It reduces stress since it won't be in the back of their mind and is more efficient since they won't have to re-read or evaluate the item again in the future  Secret #14: They practice a consistent morning routine  My single greatest surprise while interviewing over 200 highly successful people was how many of them wanted to share their morning ritual with me Hal Elrod author of The Miracle Morning told me "While most people focus on 'doing' more to achieve more The Miracle Morning is about focusing on 'becoming' more so that you can start doingless to achieve more " While I heard about a wide variety of habits most people I interviewed nurtured5 their body in the morning with water a healthy breakfast and light exercise They nurtured their mind with meditation6 or prayer inspirational reading and journaling  Secret #15: Energy is everything  You can't make more minutes in the day but you can increase your energy which will increase your attention focus decision making and overall productivity Highly successful people don't skip meals sleep or breaks in the pursuit of more more more Instead they view food as fuel sleep as recovery and pulse and pause with "work sprints7"  work and a full nine pages about every trip and vacation he'd ever taken  In July Grandpa worsened One hot afternoon arrived when no one else was at his bedside He was glad to have me there and reached out his hand to pull me close  I told Grandpa what I had learned -- that few flowers last from April to November Some of the most beautiful bloom for only a month at most To really enjoy a garden you have to plant corners and drifts and rows of flowers that will bloom and grace the garden each in its own season  His eyes listened to every word Then another discovery: "If I want a garden like yours Grandpa I'm going to have to work " His grin laughed at me and his eyes teased me  "Grandpa in your life right now the chrysanthemums5 are in bloom Chrysanthemums and roses " Tears clouded both our eyes Neither of us feared this last flower of fall but the wait for spring seems longest in November We knew how much we would miss each other  Sitting there I suddenly felt that the best gift I could give Grandpa would be to give voice to the testimony6 inside both of us He had never spoken of his testimony to me but it was such a part of his life that I had never questioned if Grandpa knew I knew he knew  "Grandpa " I began -- and his grip tightened7 as if he knew what I was going to say -- "I want you to know that I have a testimony I know the Savior lives I bear witness to you that Joseph Smith is a prophet I love the Restoration and joy in it " The steadiness in Grandpa's eyes told how much he felt it too "I bear witness that President Kimball is a prophet I know the Book of Mormon is true Grandpa Every part of me bears this witness " "Grandpa " I added quietly "I know our Father in Heaven loves you " Unbidden unexpected the Spirit bore comforting poignant8 testimony to me of our Father's love for my humble quiet Grandpa  A tangible9 sense of Heavenly Father's compassionate10 awareness of Grandpa's suffering surrounded us and held us It was so personal and powerful that no words were left to me -- only tears of gratitude11 and humility12 tears of comfort  Grandpa and I wept together  It was the end of August when Grandpa died the end of summer As we were choosing flowers from the florist13 for Grandpa's funeral I slipped away to Grandpa's garden and walked with my memories of columbine and Sweet William Only the tall lavender and white phlox were in bloom now and some baby's breath in another corner  On impulse I cut the prettiest strands14 of phlox and baby's breath and made one more arrangement for the funeral When they saw it friends and family all smiled to see Grandpa's flowers there We all felt how much Grandpa would have liked that  The October after Grandpa's death I planted tulip and daffodil bulbs snowdrops crocuses and bluebells15 Each bulb was a comfort to me a love sent to Grandpa a promise of spring
