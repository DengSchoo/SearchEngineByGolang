"Can I see my baby " the happy new mother asked  When the bundle was nestled in her arms and she moved the fold of cloth to look upon his tiny face she gasped1 The doctor turned quickly and looked out the tall hospital window The baby had been born without ears  Time proved that the baby's hearing was perfect It was only his appearance that was marred2 When he rushed home from school one day and flung himself into his mother's arms she sighed knowing that his life was to be a succession of heartbreaks  He blurted3 out the tragedy "A boy a big boy called me a freak " He grew up handsome for his misfortune A favorite with his fellow students he might have been class president but for that He developed a gift a talent for literature and music  "But you might mingle4 with other young people " his mother reproved him but felt a kindness in her heart  The boy's father had a session with the family physician "Could nothing be done " "I believe I could graft5 on a pair of outer ears if they could be procured " the doctor decided6 Whereupon the search began for a person who would make such a sacrifice for a young man  Two years went by One day his father said to the son "You're going to the hospital son Mother and I have someone who will donate the ears you need But it's a secret " The operation was a brilliant success and a new person emerged His talents blossomed into genius and school and college became a series of triumphs  Later he married and entered the diplomatic service One day he asked his father Who gave me the ears Who gave me so much I could never do enough for him or her  "I do not believe you could " said the father "but the agreement was that you are not to know not yet " The years kept their profound secret but the day did come One of the darkest days that ever pass through a son He stood with his father over his mother's casket Slowly tenderly the father stretched forth7 a hand and raised the thick reddish brown hair to reveal the mother had no outer ears  "Mother said she was glad she never let her hair be cut " his father whispered gently "and nobody ever thought mother less beautiful did they " REMEMBER  Real beauty lies not in the physical appearance  but in the heart  Real treasure lies not in what can be seen  but what cannot be seen  Real love lies not in what is done and known  but in what that is done but not known own r seem too little to You God You sit up there so white and old with all the angels about You and the stars slipping by And I come to You with a prayer about a telephone call Ah don't laugh God You see You don't know how it feels You're so safe there on Your throne with the blue swirling1 under You Nothing can touch You; no one can twist Your heart in his hands This is suffering God this is bad bad suffering Won't You help me For Your Son's sake help me You said You would do whatever was asked of You in His name Oh God in the name of Thine6 only beloved Son Jesus Christ our Lord let him telephone me now  I must stop this I mustn't be this way Look Suppose a young man says he'll call a girl up and then something happens and he doesn't That isn't so terrible is it Why it's going on all over the world right this minute Oh what do I care what's going on all over the world Why can't that telephone ring Why can't it why can't it Couldn't you ring Ah please couldn't you You damned3 ugly shiny thing It would hurt you to ring wouldn't it Oh that would hurt you Damn2 you I'll pull your filthy4 roots out of the wall I'll smash5 your smug black face in little bits 7 Damn you to hell  No no no I must stop I must think about something else This is what I'll do I'll put the clock in the other room Then I can't look at it If I do have to look at it then I'll have to walk into the bedroom and that will be something to do Maybe before I look at it again he will call me I'll be so sweet to him if he calls me If he says he can't see me tonight I'll say "Why that's all right dear Why of course it's all right " I'll be the way I was when I first met him Then maybe he'll like me again I was always sweet at first Oh it's so easy to be sweet to people before you love them  I think he must still like me a little He couldn't have called me "darling" twice today if he didn't still like me a little It isn't all gone if he still likes me a little; even if it's only a little little bit You see God if You would just let him telephone me I wouldn't have to ask You anything more I would be sweet to him I would be gay I would be just the way I used to be and then he would love me again And then I would never have to ask You for anything more Don't You see God So won't You please let him telephone me Won't You please please please #p##e# Are You punishing me God because I've been bad Are You angry with me because I did that Oh but God there are so many bad people You could not be hard only to me And it wasn't very bad; it couldn't have been bad We didn't hurt anybody God Things are only bad when they hurt people We didn't hurt one single soul; You know that You know it wasn't bad don't You God So won't You let him telephone me now  If he doesn't telephone me I'll know God is angry with me I'll count five hundred by fives and if he hasn't called me then I will know God isn't going to help me ever again That will be the sign Five ten fifteen twenty twenty-five thirty thirty-five forty forty-five fifty fifty-five  It was bad I knew it was bad All right God send me to hell You think You're frightening me with Your hell don't You You think Your hell is worse than mine  I mustn't I mustn't do this Suppose he's a little late calling me up that's nothing to get hysterical6 about Maybe he isn't going to call maybe he's coming straight up here without telephoning He'll be cross10 if he sees I have been crying They don't like you to cry He doesn't cry I wish to God I could make him cry I wish I could make him cry and tread7 the floor and feel his heart heavy and big and festering in him I wish I could hurt him like hell  He doesn't wish that about me I don't think he even knows how he makes me feel I wish he could know without my telling him They don't like you to tell them they've made you cry They don't like you to tell them you're unhappy because of them If you do they think you're possessive and exacting8 And then they hate you They hate you whenever you say anything you really think You always have to keep playing little games Oh I thought we didn't have to; I thought this was so big I could say whatever I meant I guess you can't ever I guess there isn't ever anything big enough for that Oh if he would just telephone I wouldn't tell him I had been sad about him They hate sad people I would be so sweet and so gay he couldn't help but like me If he would only telephone If he would only telephone  Maybe that's what he is doing Maybe he is coming on here without calling me up Maybe he's on his way now Something might have happened to him No nothing could ever happen to him I can't picture anything happening to him I never picture him run over I never see him lying still and long and dead I wish he were dead That's a terrible wish That's a lovely wish If he were dead he would be mine If he were dead I would never think of now and the last few weeks I would remember only the lovely times It would be all beautiful I wish he were dead I wish he were dead dead dead  This is silly It's silly to go wishing people were dead just because they don't call you up the very minute they said they would Maybe the clock's fast; I don't know whether it's right Maybe he's hardly late at all Anything could have made him a little late Maybe he had to stay at his office Maybe he went home to call me up from there and somebody came in He doesn't like to telephone me in front of people Maybe he's worried just a little little bit about keeping me waiting He might even hope that I would call him up I could do that I could telephone him  I mustn't I mustn't I mustn't Oh God please don't let me telephone him Please keep me from doing that I know God just as well as You do that if he were worried about me he'd telephone no matter where he was or how many people there were around him Please make me know that God I don't ask YOU to make it easy for me You can't do that for all that You could make a world Only let me know it God Don't let me go on hoping Don't let me say comforting things to myself Please don't let me hope dear God Please don't  I won't telephone him I'll never telephone him again as long as I live He'll rot in hell before I'll call him up You don't have to give me strength God; I have it myself If he wanted me he could get me He knows where I am He knows I'm waiting here He's so sure of me so sure I wonder why they hate you as soon as they are sure of you I should think it would be so sweet to be sure  It would be so easy to telephone him Then I'd know Maybe it wouldn't be a foolish thing to do Maybe he wouldn't mind Maybe he'd like it Maybe he has been trying to get me Sometimes people try and try to get you on the telephone and they say the number doesn't answer I'm not just saying that to help myself; that really happens You know that really happens God Oh God keep me away from that telephone Keep me away Let me still have just a little bit of pride I think I'm going to need it God I think it will be all I'll have  Oh what does pride matter when I can't stand it if I don't talk to him Pride like that is such a silly shabby little thing The real pride the big pride is in having no pride I'm not saying that just because I want to call him I am not That's true I know that's true I will be big I will be beyond little prides #p##e# Please God keep me from telephoning him Please God  I don't see what pride has to do with it This is such a little thing for me to be bringing in pride for me to be making such a fuss9 about I may have misunderstood him Maybe he said for me to call him up at five "Call me at five darling " He could have said that perfectly10 well It's so possible that I didn't hear him right "Call me at five darling " I'm almost sure that's what he said God don't let me talk this way to myself Make me know please make me know  I'll think about something else I'll just sit quietly If I could sit still If I could sit still Maybe I could read Oh all the books are about people who love each other truly and sweetly What do they want to write about that for Don't they know it isn't true Don't they know it's a lie it's a God damned lie What do they have to tell about that for when they know how it hurts Damn them damn them damn them  I won't I'll be quiet This is nothing to get excited about Look Suppose he were someone I didn't know very well Suppose he were another girl Then I'd just telephone and say "Well for goodness' sake what happened to you " That's what I'd do and I'd never even think about it Why can't I be casual and natural just because I love him I can be Honestly I can be I'll call him up and be so easy and pleasant You see if I won't God Oh don't let me call him Don't don't don't  God aren't You really going to let him call me Are You sure God Couldn't You please relent Couldn't You I don't even ask You to let him telephone me this minute God; only let him do it in a little while I'll count five hundred by fives I'll do it so slowly and so fairly If he hasn't telephoned then I'll call him I will Oh please dear God dear kind God my blessed Father in Heaven let him call before then Please God Please  Five ten fifteen twenty twenty-five thirty thirty-five
