1 Not traveling when you had the chance Traveling becomes infinitely1 harder the older you get especially if you have a family and need to pay the way for three-plus people instead of just yourself  2 Not learning2 another language You'll kick yourself when you realize you took three years of language in high school and remember none of it  3 Staying in a bad relationship No one who ever gets out of a bad relationship looks back without wishing they made the move sooner  4 Not quitting a terrible job Look you gotta pay the bills But if you don't make a plan to improve your situation you might wake up one day having spent 40 years in hell3  5 Not trying harder in school It's not just that your grades play a role in determining where you end up in life Eventually you'll realize how neat it was to get to spend all day learning and wish you'd paid more attention  6 Not realizing how beautiful you were Too many of us spend our youth unhappy with the way we look but the reality is that's when we're our most beautiful  7 Failing to finish what you start I had big dreams of becoming a nurse I even signed up for the classes but then 8 Caring too much about what other people think In 20 years you won't give a damn4 about any of those people you once worried so much about  9 Worrying too much As Tom Petty5 sang Most things I worry about never happen anyway  10 Not being grateful6 sooner It can be hard to see in the beginning but eventually it becomes clear that every moment on this earth -- from the mundane7 to the amazing -- is a gift that we're all so incredibly lucky to share million (in the USSR) First edition: 1869 Leo Tolstoy a Russian writer decided6 to demonstrate his beliefs that there is some greater power forming our history Along with the fact he didn't like popular history and being a war veteran he then wrote one of the largest and most popular novels in the world literature War and Peace  This jewel among books is divided in four volumes each being a follow up of the previous one War and Peace has indeed a lot of characters both fictional7 and real historic figures The plot is set in the beginning of the 19th century when Napoleon invades Russia  Interesting fact is that although War and Peace is clearly a Russian literature from a Russian author parts of the book are written in French - probably because most of the story is focused on 5 noble families and nobility in Russia used to speak French in that particular era  Think and Grow Rich Author: Napoleon Hill # of sold copies: 30 million First edition: 1937 There are tons of motivational books these days Some are better some are worse and it's up to you to choose the one that can really help you Think and Grow Rich is probably a safe bet because it takes a bit of ingenuity8 to write something everybody knows these days - only 70 years ahead  The best way how to become successful is to find out what others did before success came to them - and that's exactly what Napoleon Hill did According to his mentor's (A Carnegie) advice he studied the life paths of 16 wealthy individuals and pointed9 out their steps to victory  If you're looking for personal development tools Think and Grow Rich should be on the top of your priorities  Nineteen Eighty-Four Author: George Orwell # of sold copies: 25 million First edition:1949 History has shown us that mankind is capable of both terrible and good things and it's a matter of conscience which side prevails George Orwell took the liberty to tell us how what the world look like if despotic and oppressive regimes took the upper hand  In the imaginary year 1984 the Earth is divided among three major nations which constantly wage war against each other The main character named Winston Smith lives in Oceania ruled by one party - called The Party Everything is scarce basic human right and emotions are constantly being twisted and above all The Big Brother is always watching  Although 1984 is quite gloomy and despairing we have to acknowledge that it's still in our "grasp" to create such a scenario10 It needed to be said out loud in order to realize how absurd and sick such totalitarian practices are
