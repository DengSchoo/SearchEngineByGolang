If a woman is not sexy she needs emotion; if she is not emotional1 she needs reason; if she is not reasonable she has to know herself clearly Only she has is misfortune2   An unacceptable love needs no sorrow but time- sometime for forgetting A badly-hurt heart needs no sympathy but understanding  I know someone in the world is waiting for me although I've no idea of who he is But I feel happy every day for this  In your life there will at least one time that you forget yourself for some one asking for no result no company no ownership3 nor love Just ask for meeting you in my most beautiful years  When you feel hurt and your tears are gonna to drop Please look up and have a look at the sky once belongs to us If the sky is still vast clouds are still clear you shall not cry because my leave doesn't takeaway the world that belongs to you ; I don't think that when people grow up they will become more broad-minded and can accept everything Conversely4 I think it's a selecting process knowing what's the most important and what's the least And then be a simple man  terminal I was early for my flight so I decided5 to go back  I did  and just as I was about to reboard the train for my gate I saw that the man and his son had returned too I realized then that they hadn't been heading for a flight but had just been riding the shuttle  "I want to ride some more " "More " the father said mock-exasperated but clearly pleased "You're not tired " "This is fun " his son said  "All right " the father replied and when a door opened we all got on  There are parents who can afford to send their children to Europe or Disneyland and the children turn out rotten There are parents who live in million-dollar houses and give their children cars and swimming pools yet something goes wrong Rich and poor black and white so much goes wrong so often  "Where are all these people going Daddy " the son asked  "All over the world " came the reply The other people in the air port wee leaving for distant destinations or arriving at the ends of their journeys The father and son though were just riding this shuttle together making it exciting sharing each other's company  So many troubles in this country - crime the murderous soullessness that seems to be taking over the lives of many young people the lowering of educational standards the increase in vile6 obscenities in public the disappearance7 of simple civility So many questions about what to do Here was a father who cared about spending the day with his son and who had come up with this plan on a Saturday morning  The answer is so simple: parents who care enough to spend time and to pay attention and to try their best It doesn't cost a cent yet it is the most valuable thing in the world  The train picked up speed and the father pointed8 something out and the boy laughed again  dreams  just in case they would become true one day  Yes  be ordinary and be happy
