 Ask most people which day of the week they dread1 the most and the answer is likely to be Monday The first day of the week can make us grouchy2 and depressed3 which is why the feeling is described as the Monday blues4 But what is it exactly that makes us feel down and does it affect everyone Apparently5 the most depressing day of the year is the third Monday in January when its cold and dark outside This day was nicknamed Blue Monday by psychologist Cliff Arnall in 2004 He came up with it after a holiday company asked him for a scientific formula for the January blues Even if there was little science behind the formula its probably true that the sound of our alarm clock on any Monday morning signals the dawning of a new week and possibly the end of our weekend of fun Research shows our Monday mood can be based on a direct comparison to the day before Its what psychologists call an emotional shift and no other part of the week has a transition like it Monday means the end of weekend lieins its back to the routine and the realisation that there are five days ahead of the ninetofive and according to the BBC Bitesize website If you cant stand your job then the Monday blues can be very real And your miserable6 Monday is followed by trying Tuesday the most popular day for sending out job applications But is Monday as bad as we like to think it is Feeling a bit low shouldnt be confused with more serious depression caused by other factors Writing for the BBC author and presenter7 Claudia Hammond argues that this low feeling might be a myth She says: There is a strong cultural idea that we dont like Mondays She mentions an Australian study in 2008 about how people reflected on their mood and found the day that scored the lowest was in fact Wednesdays So when Monday comes maybe we should give it a second chance es maybe we should give it a second chance ce ts that your kids can give to family members for the holidays to teach them about what they can do to help protect the planet 		 	llback of giving vouchers7 to spend in a shop 	 	Of course  if you can't think of an original way to give a gift  the alternative is to not buy anything at all  You may be accused of being a 'Scrooge' but at least you're not wasting money on pointless gifts and you could give the money to charity instead  a more worthy8 cause  But if this year  you receive a present that's not to your liking9 don't be ungrateful and remember the age-old saying that 'it's the thought that counts' ree years ago, or even worse, great thing that happened to someone they knew three years ago."
	"You sort of tell them half-heartedly that something happened to you. And then they give you a whack1 and then they talk about great thing that happened to them three years ago, or even worse, great thing that happened to someone they knew three years ago."
