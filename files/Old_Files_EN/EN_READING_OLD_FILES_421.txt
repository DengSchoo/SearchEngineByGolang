Please my dear be so generous as to let me have a little world of my own If you find me scrawling1 on a piece of paper please don't peep over my shoulders It may be that I'm venting2 some pent-up feelings long dennied expression or trying to compose a little poem not yet presentable for a time being or attempting to sketch3 out something visualized4 fron mychildhood memories which glowsing my minf like a rainbow When I am in such a mood Please leave me along and let me write as the pen dictates5 Don't disturb me my dear when I get nostalgic over some old photos or letters which bring tears to my eyes or smiles on my lips for those were things that had happened to me before I met you the joys and sorrows partings and reunions that taste like green olive or glitter like scattered6 pearls They are my cherished memories which ready as I am to share with you I would like to indulge in by myself for a while  I hope you won't mind when I go without you for a nice chat with a close friend of mine You are my bosom7 friend but you cannot take the place of other friends any more than they can do yours I need their care encouragement and sobering criticism just as I do yours A starless sky with a solitary8 moon would be dull and cheerless why not let there be a moonlit night resplendent with twinkling stars  I may occasionally want to make a tour of faraway places Please don't hold me back when I start picking for it You are the center of my life but certainly not the whole of it I yearn9 to see the mysteries and wonders of the world miles away beyond the mountains; So let me have a chance to explore my "Alice's Wonderland" as a "lone10 ranger11" Some time later when I come back to you with exotic experiences and fresh insights I'm sure you will look at me in a new light  My dear so long as you let me have such a little little world I'll be very much indebted to you life after knowing some of the secrets mentioned in this book  Read it  for it teaches you to become rich  notinstantaneously but strategically aving for distant destinations or arriving at the ends of their journeys  The father and son  though  were just riding this shuttle together  making it exciting  sharing each other's company  So many troubles in this country - crime  the murderous soullessness that seems to be taking over the lives of many young people  the lowering of educational standards  the increase in vile6 obscenities in public  the disappearance7 of simple civility  So many questions about what to do  Here was a father who cared about spending the day with his son and who had come up with this plan on a Saturday morning  The answer is so simple: parents who care enough to spend time  and to pay attention and to try their best  It doesn't cost a cent  yet it is the most valuable thing in the world  The train picked up speed  and the father pointed8 something out  and the boy laughed again d be more realistic  Happiness is THE ultimate goal of our lives  and it is both worthwhile and attainable18  Understand your purpose is to blossom into the highest  happiest version of you and let go of any guilt19 you feel for making your happiness a priority
