An ancient Hebraic text says: "love is as strong as death" It seems that not everyone experiences this kind of strong love The increasing probably crime and war tells us that the world is in indispensable1 need of true love But what is true love  Love is something we all need But how do we know when we experience it  True love is best seen as the promotion2 and action not an emotion Love is not exclusively based how we feel Certainly our emotions are involved But they cannot be our only criteria3 for love True love is when you care enough about another person that you will lay down your life for them When this happens then love truly is as strong as death How many of you have a mother or father husband or wife son or daughter or friend who would sacrifice his or her own life on yours Those of you who truly love your spells but unchildren would unselfishly lay your life on the line to save them from death Many people in an emergency room with their loved ones and prayed "please God take me instead of them" Find true love and be a true lover as well May you find a love which is not only strong as death but to leave to a truly for feeling life to see more mountains and swim in more waters and keep on counting the stars because somewhere it is written that I must continue to live my life the way I knows how to  hear and what he wanted to give the audience in terms of knowledge  And when this success ratio is unity9  you never skip a word from the speaker  Communication skills are an important forte10 and they add a very important dimension to your personality  When you communicate clearly and openly  you always make your wants  needs and doubts obvious  This clarity is essential to market yourself and synchronizes11 yourself with other two-legged intellectuals like you  You may not be that well qualified12  but with good communication skills you can crack your interview and you can sell yourself convincingly  You then don't try to fill in a vacancy13 in a company but make a place for yourself  Some of the essential tips for communication include: Be clear  concise14 and straightforward15  Keep your sentences short  This will avoid grammatical mistakes  Look into the eyes of the person you are speaking to  This gives a glimpse of your sincerity16 and dedication17 to the other person  Even if you slip up somewhere  maintain your calm  apologize and continue  Don't try to reanalyze such slip ups  because we wish to promote ourselves and not demote  So from now on communicate clearly  properly and openly  as after all the world doesn't know what you need  Does it
