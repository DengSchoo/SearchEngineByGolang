On a bench in Regen s Park London on October 7 1970 a young man studying for MBA degree at London Business School met an Irish1 girl who first arrived in London 1970107MBAThe young man was about to graduate from the business school and become a ninetofiver As a matter of fact he was going to become an engineer at Chrysler Corporation2 However his life trajectory3 was about to change because of the girl in front of him The two of them fell in love at first sight and married a year later Normally4 they would probably each get a stable5 job and live a middleclass life day in and day out But they think they want more freedom in their life As a result the young couple bought a small car a year later and started an overland journey through Europe and Asia Eventually they crossed the whole Oceania6 and arrived in Australia Here they met with many other people who want to travel on their own all of whom are eager to know the details of their travels So the couple published a book to share their travel experiences In the end they opened a company that popularized all kinds of travel knowledge and experience and thus became the richest backpackers in the world The young man is called Tony Wheeler and the Irish girl is Mauren Wheeler That is how Lonely Planet7 was born rish girl is Mauren Wheeler 	··	 	That is how Lonely Planet7 was born 	learn 	 	My parents searched for a cure At that time we did not even have a name for what I had I suffered silently through school until I was ten years old when one in a long string of psychologists had an idea Having discussed his plan with my parents beforehand one day in my therapy session I was asked by the psychologist what I wanted more than anything in the world He explained that I was going to be given an opportunity to work for what I wanted I couldn't believe my good luck but I could not answer I just stood there struggling to verbalize what I wanted more than anything else in the world Finally I was permitted to whisper the answer in my mother's ear "A horse " was all I could say 	 	I was to get a pony5 but before we could even start looking I had to live up to my end of the bargain I had to try to talk I had a chart of weekly tasks I had to accomplish I had to answer the phone five times per week something I had never done before I had to make five phone calls to my friends I had to say one word to my teacher at school and the list went on For a child with Selective Mutism saying one word to someone can be like climbing Mount Everest 	 	I did everything that was asked of me and the day came when my parents found a local riding stable that had the perfect pony His name was Sequoia6 a strong little chestnut7 with some roaning and a tiny white spot on his rump He was perfect of course and I fell in love immediately We boarded him at the riding stable and I began taking lessons I wanted to be the best I could be and I swelled8 with pride every time I got on Sequoia It truly was a dream come true I learned to brush him saddle him pick his hooves out Each week I could not wait for Saturday and my lesson then my free time with my Sequoia When I was in Sequoia's presence I forgot all about my problems and felt strong and secure 	 	As I see it horses are silent too but they are fast powerful and free at the same time Horses give me the strength I lack They give me a reason to push myself when I can find no other Horses have been part of my life for well over twenty years now all the while helping9 me deal with an isolating10 frightening disorder When things get difficult as they still sometimes do I go to my horses With them I can be silent but I can hold my head up and have dignity and freedom By connecting with them I have learned to embrace what I was once shunned11 for and I found my voice 	 	I am a fully4 participating member of society these days My horses and I made it through a master's degree and then law school I am a practicing attorney I even make court appearances I may have made it otherwise but I'm not sure I feel I owe my life to the horse and I try to give it back to them every day I am fortunate that I can look out my back door and see my beautiful horses looking back at me I am so grateful that I get to watch them run in their mountain pasture every day I hope I never stop learning from them They have given me the best gift I could ever imagine my life  one boy who has changed many lives 	 	You see it's simple really A change took place within the heart of one boy all because of one teacher who cared
