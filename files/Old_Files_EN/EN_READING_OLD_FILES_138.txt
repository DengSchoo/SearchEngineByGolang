My neighbor Mrs Gargan first told me about it Have you seen the tree she asked as I was sitting in the backyard enjoying the October twilight1 The one down at the corner she explained Its a beautiful treeall kinds of colors Cars are stopping to look You ought to see it I told her I would but I soon forgot about the tree Three days later I was jogging down the street my mind swimming with petty worries when a splash of bright orange caught my eye For an instant I thought someones house had caught fire Then I remembered the tree As I approached it I slowed to a walk There was nothing remarkable2 about the shape of the tree a mediumsized maple3 But Mrs Gargan had been right about its colors Like the messy whirl of an artists palette the tree blazed a bright crimson4 on its lower branches burned with vivid yellows and oranges in its center and simmered to deep red at its top Through these fiery5 colors cascaded6 thin rivulets7 of palegreen leaves and blotches8 of deepgreen leaves as yet untouched by autumn Edging closerlike a pilgrim approaching a shrineI noticed several bare branches near the top their black twigs9 scratching the air like claws The leaves they had shed lay like a scarlet10 carpet around the trunk With its varied11 nations of color this tree seemed to become a globe embracing in its broad branches all seasons and continents: the spring and summer of the Southern hemisphere in the light and dark greens the autumn and winter of the Northern in the blazing yellows and bare branches As I marveled at this allencompassing beauty I thought of Ralph Waldo Emersons comments about the stars If the constellations12 appeared only once in a thousand years he observed in Nature imagine what an exciting event it would be But because theyre up there every night we barely give them a look I felt the same way about the tree Because its majesty13 will last only a week it should be especially precious to us And I had almost missed it Once when Emily Dickensons father noticed a brilliant display of northern lights in the sky over Massachusetts he tolled14 a church bell to alert townspeople Thats what I felt like doing about the tree I wanted to become a Paul Revere15 of autumn awakening16 the countryside to its wonder I didnt have a church bell or a horse but as I walked home I did ask each neighbor I passed the same simple but momentous17 question Mrs Gargan had asked me: Have you seen the tree :  Mrs Gargan had asked me: "Have you seen the tree "	:" " they are choosing joy All these different shades of red blue and green make life more exciting 	 		They say that hate breeds hate but why can't love ignite love joy increase joy I say let's make kindness go viral Choose joy and let the color spread as we paint ourselves a new world 	You end up feeling irritated and guilty because as much as you want to forget well you can't People are laziest when they're in denial Imagine you have a paper due next week In the back of your mind you know it's gonna be a ton of work You still have to gather sources find quotes write your thesis you know the list goes on and on Yet here you are spending hours on social media You convince yourself you still have plenty of time but your gut10 is telling you otherwise Whenever you continue thinking about one thing it means it's time to get started Not tomorrow not in a few hours right now Because this thought isn't just popping up out of nowhere It's the productive part of your brain telling you the right thing to do So don't try to block it out with TV or video games You can use the same trick when you have a completely packed to-do list If you're struggling to figure out what to do first tackle the task that you can't stop thinking about The longer you try to ignore it the more frustrated11 you're gonna feel You'll never feel satisfied until you get that big-ticket item out of your head 		 	Number three the power of reliability12 		 	Even if you're great about setting new goals you may have a hard time following through You might make a to-do list and lay out specific concrete steps but what stops you from bailing14 at the last minute Let's say you want to start working out You research exercises you buy gym clothes and you even get a gym membership Yet you never actually show up You end up watching TV or playing video games because well you can If you decide to skip the gym for the tenth time you're not affecting anyone but yourself There's no one there to hold you accountable You should use reliability to motivate yourself to do things that you normally wouldn't So the next time you plan on going to the gym ask one of your friends to meet you there That way someone else will be counting on you to show up They'll expect you to follow through so if you don't you won't get off scot-free like you did before Reliability is effective for a number of reasons but trust is a big one You show up because you don't want to blow off your friend You invited them to the gym so you can't just bail13 because you're feeling lazy Sitting around watching Netflix is a pretty terrible reason to damage a friendship Reliability also motivates you because you want your friend to think highly of you You want them to see you as someone who takes their goals seriously So when you're on your own it's easier to fail because no one has to know about it Your friends and family won't have a different opinion of you if you don't go But now your friend will see firsthand whether you're following through or not So you show up to make sure you leave a good impression For the same reason you're more likely to actually try while you're there You can't just leave after five minutes or sit on your phone the whole time Sitting there watching your friend do what they're supposed to do will motivate you to follow suit Finally reliability can make things more fun It gives you someone to talk to which relieves anxiety and stress Your friend might also be more experienced so they can help you get the most out of whatever you're doing If you're struggling to find motivation on your own hey there's no shame in calling for backup The simple fact that someone else is involved will jumpstart your work ethic15 	105	 	Number four undermine your fears 		 	Sometimes our laziness isn't really laziness You might procrastinate16 or avoid doing something because well you're worried about what will happen when you try You might have set your expectations way too high You might feel an overwhelming amount of pressure to succeed This can make even the smallest chores feel like huge responsibilities You end up running away because you can't fail at something that you never actually do Now to avoid this kind of laziness check your expectations at the door In other words when you start a project you only have one job and that's to start Don't be afraid of making something terrible just begin working on the first thing that pops into your mind This gets you past that initial roadblock Every project is way less intimidating17 when you're already halfway18 done This is the same reason that teachers encourage their students to write rough drafts You make something rough and imperfect to get an idea of where you're headed Yeah it won't be very good because it's not supposed to be There aren't any expectations or pressure but you'll find that things seem a lot more doable afterwards So when you're feeling lazy don't be afraid to get a little messy Improving something bad's a whole lot easier than making something perfect from scratch 		 	Number five dress for productivity 		 	Where are you the laziest Well if you're like most people you probably feel lethargic19 whenever you're trying to work or study in your room And your clothes maybe the biggest reason why Now everyone knows it's a whole lot more comfortable to work in sweatpants or pajamas20 If you're gonna spend all day doing something that you don't want to you might as well be comfy right The truth is your clothes can directly affect your habits This is one of the biggest reasons why so many companies make their employees dress up for work even if they aren't interacting with customers Your brain naturally associates your habits with your environment Think about studying in your room versus21 studying in the library the latter is way more efficient because your brain doesn't see your room as a workspace So when you're in your room your brain unconsciously thinks about relaxation22 and sleep because that's what it's used to doing But the library puts you in a different mental space this new environment primes your brain to work and think harder than it would anywhere else Clothes work the exact same way What are you usually doing when you wear sweatpants Chances are you aren't taking tests or going to meetings you're probably playing video games or watching TV So that's what your brain thinks about when you're wearing them The lazier your clothes are the lazier you'll feel To overcome this kind of laziness change into clothes that help you focus Don't worry you don't have to wear a suit and tie You should choose something you wouldn't mind wearing out into the world This is an especially helpful tip for students and people who work from home Yeah it's tempting23 to lounge around all day in your comfiest outfit24 but you need to tell your brain when it's time to shift gears A change of clothing is an easy and effective way to do just that
