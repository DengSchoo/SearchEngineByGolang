Mother Teresa of Calcutta was often quoted as saying: I know God will not give me anything I cant handle I just wish He didnt trust me so much Over the years I have found myself often feeling the same way I have had a blessed life but it has never been an easy one In my 45 years I have had to deal with sickness injuries accidents and pain I have had to deal with years of poverty and financial struggles I have had to deal with my sons mental handicaps1 the death of loved ones and being separated from those I love I have had to deal with anger betrayal2 confusion3 depression and at times even despair Like so many before me I have asked the question: Why do bad things happen to good people It is a question that has been asked throughout the ages Books have even been written about it When I remember all that I have faced and gone through in this life I realize that God has used all of it to eventually make me better With pain came empathy With grief4 came healing With frustration1 came patience With struggles came strength With sorrow came joy With anger came love And with despair came trust in God Every test challenge and tragedy eventually led me to greater goodness greater love and greater Oneness with our Heavenly Father None of us likes the negative experiences in life None of us enjoys pain None of us wants to go through sorrow May each day here then help you to grow better and more loving to grow better and more loving n; they are easy to make so you can get your fix of feel-good food quickly  However  we often feel so good that we eat too much  and even though we know the ingredients are high in carbohydrates5  sugar or salt  we continue to pig out  Psychologist Shira Gabriel told the BBC: "We feel guilty because we don't realise that what's happening is our minds [are] finding a way to trigger a really positive emotion and they're making us eat that food to do so "
	 
	Maybe we should take comfort from the fact that eating certain food just makes us feel happy  But  for some people  eating any kind of food brings joy  warmth  happiness and comfort  dirty clothing for a full load 
	 
	6  Use water-efficient appliances 
	 
	The next time you need to replace a dishwasher  washing machine  or water heater  purchase a water-efficient appliance  Not only will this cut back on your water consumption  but you'll save money over time when it comes to utility costs 
	 
	7  Avoid washing your car or use a bucket 
	 
	Put the hose down and let the rain clean your car for you  If you do feel the need to wash your vehicle  fill a few buckets instead of using your garden hose to clean your vehicle off and rinse6 it  If you use a hose to wash your vehicle  you'll use roughly 190 L of water  A few buckets will only require 19–38 L  though one means that we have one group  and the zero helps us remember that it means one group  not one thing 
	But 10  just like one  just like a dozen eggs  just like an egg  10 is a unit 
	And 10 tens make 100 
	So when I think about 100  it's like the box of toaster pastries 
	Is 100 one thing  10 things or 100 things 
	And that depends on what "one" is  it depends on what the unit is 
	So think about all the times in math when you write the number one 
	No matter what place that one is in  no matter how many things that one represents  one is
