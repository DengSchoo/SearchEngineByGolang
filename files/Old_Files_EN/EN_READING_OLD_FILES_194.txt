Our families camped together once a month so when the Fourth of July fell on our scheduled weekend we never gave it a thought not to proceed with our plans The drive to Rehoboth Beach took six hours counting four bathroom stops for three children and two women and two men who swore they would lay off the water The campsite was five miles from the pristine1 shoreline and boardwalk We couldnt wait to dig our toes into the warm sand Our daughter was seven at the time and our friends daughters were eight and three We packed enough toys beach towels and tanning lotion2 to last three weekends After pitching our tents and setting up camp the seven of us piled into our cars and began the hunt for parking spaces closest to the water so that the men would not have to resort to camellike behavior when hauling our supplies to the beach We staked our claim on the remaining ten feet of sand and sent the children to the oceans edge Our striped towels and white flesh blended with the thousands of other sun worshipers Music blared from crankedup radios while Frisbees whizzed overhead Fairhaired recruits in muscle shirts hawked3 their ice cream sandwiches and cold soda4 while I poured lukewarm KoolAid From where I reclined I had a clear view of the three girls splashing near the water They chased the waves and tunneled into the wet sand building castle after castle It took extreme persuasion5 to convince them to relinquish6 the sea long enough to split soggy sandwiches with us Periodically the men would drop their books and leap into an incoming wave while capturing an unsuspecting child I could only imagine the giggles7 above the beach clatter8 After hours of play and sunburned feet we motioned for the girls to join us I packed the towels and lotion while my best friend packed the toys and food We each had our responsibilities but neglected the most important one My daughter and her eldest9 daughter arrived by our side Their youngest girl didnt We locked eyes Our previously10 orderly world shrunk to the beach and the thousands of people strewn around us Instinct jolted11 us into action We screamed her name and pushed past bathers and tanners frantic12 to find a missing child in a green bathing suit Each second ticked by as though specifically designed to torment13 us Angela My head snapped as the perfect picture of a mother and daughter reuniting exploded in my vision I wanted to fall to the ground and weep amid the mass of strangers who had been unsuspecting participants in a drama unfolding before them Since that day Ive relived those five minutes of fear at Rehoboth Beach too many times I relived them each time my daughter hid from me behind a store fixture14 or ventured out alone in the car after passing her drivers test I relived them when she was late returning home from dates and when she married and moved to a city far from my reach Years later we relocated to Florida where once a month we frequent the swarming15 beaches of Daytona My husband and I rent beach chairs and an umbrella and stake our claim along with the other beach lovers hoping for a relaxing time in the sun Invariably I spy a child dropping his bucket to search for his own cluster of recognizable faces My heart freezes until I witness the mother wrapping her arms around him again Only then do I breathe and rejoin the masses im again Only then do I breathe and rejoin the masses
