Touch Me is a soliloquy composed by Hank Miller1 about the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington D C also known as "The Wall" This monument is one of the most visited sites in the city of Washington -- By Hank Miller (California professional photographer freelance writer former Naval2 Aviator3 and a Vietnam veteran) Touch me Don't be afraid I can't hurt you Go ahead and touch my smooth surface Feel the cold glass-like smoothness and the crevices4 and lines that make me what I am Use both hands if you wish We are more similar than you dare to believe  Touch my face Yes I have a face like yours It has weathered the centuries as yours has the years My face portrays5 my evolution Yours the birth and death of a generation My face has aged6 like yours as we have endured together the testimony7 of earth elements  I have eyes like yours My inscriptions8 stare out at you as I search for the meaning of why we are here I look into your eyes and see who you are Who am I I was formed millions of years past and now you see the results of my evolution  I can feel your hands and the sweat from your palms flow into the countless9 combination of the letters that make me I know you I have known you since I was able to breathe in the air as my smoothness began to take shape and my color matured along with natural flaws You have known me since the days when you came to take me from my mother  You cannot hear me I am static and unmoving But I can hear your murmurs10 and your cries of pain and sadness Your sons and daughters ask why There are no answers I am very old I have seen everything and I am none the wiser for the pain and suffering and I have witnessed since I rose from the bowels11 of the earth I have witnessed the conflict the death the civilizations and the societies that have come before you Yet I remain mystified about this day  I feel sad yet alive with a purpose I have come to know those who are now an integral part of the reason for my being here at this place and time That purpose has become apparent as I stand before you on this day while your brethren gather to witness my reflections and the changes of light that mirror your soul  I am a reflection of you I am all of you I am your spirit  I am The Wall had more dates than me and all the girls loved him Boy sometimes I was jealous  Today was one of those days I can see that he was nervous about his speech So I smacked5 him on the back and said "Hey big guy you'll be great " He looked at me with one of those looks (the really grateful one) and smiled "Thanks " he said As he started his speech he cleared his throat and began "Graduation is a time to thank those who helped you make it through those tough years Your parents your teachers your siblings6 maybe a coach   but mostly your friends I am here to tell all of you that being a friend to someone is the best gift you can give him or her I am going to tell you a story " I just looked at my friend with disbelief as he told the story of the first day we met He had planned to kill himself over the weekend He talked of how he had cleaned out his locker7 so his Mom wouldn't have to do it later and was carrying his stuff home He looked hard at me and gave me a little smile "Thankfully I was saved My friend saved me from doing the unspeakable " I heard the gasp8 go through the crowd as this handsome popular boy told us all about his weakest moment I saw his Mom and Dad looking at me and smiling that same grateful smile Not until that moment did I realize it's depth  Never underestimate the power of your actions With one small gesture you can change a person's life For better or for worse
