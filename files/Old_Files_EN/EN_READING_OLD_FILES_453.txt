Americans are proud to be Americans  But each individual will explain that he  personally  is not like the other Americans  He is better  Americans are proud to be different from each other and from the world  There is no such thing as a plain American  Every American is a hyphenated American  And a American will say  "I am a Polish " or "I am an Italian " Because his great grandparents were born in Poland or Italy  a spirit of rug individualism proveeds virtually every aspect of American life  American's heroes are outlaws1  like wild west gunfighter Jazz Janes  or entrepreneur like Samuel Watten  founder2 of the Walmalt chain of super stores  Every American worker has fantasies of one day going into business of himself ant a wife to go along when our family takes a vacation so that somesone can aomtinue to care for me and my children when I need a rest and change of scene  I want a wife who will not bother me with rambling1 complaints about a wife's duties  But I want a wife who will listen to me when I feel the need to explain a rather difficult point I have come across in my course of studies  And I want a wife who type my papers for me when I have written them  I want a wife who will take care of the details of my social life  When my wife and I are invited out by my friends  I want a wife who will take care of the babysitting arrangements  When I meet people at school that I like who will have the house clean  will prepare a special meal  serve it to me and my friends  and not interrupt when I talk about things that interest me and my friends  I want a wife who will have arranged that the children are fed and ready for bed before my guests arrive so that the children do not bother us  I want a wife who takes care of the needs of my guests so that they feel comfortable  who makes sure that they have an sahtray  that they are offered a second helping2 of the food  that their wine glasses are replenished3 when necessary  that their coffee is served to them as they like it  And I want a wife who knows that sometimes I need a night out by myself  I want a wife who is sensitive to my *ual needs  a wife who makes love passionately4 and eagerly when I feel like it  a wife who makes sure that I am satisfied  And  of course  I want a wife who will not demand *ual attention when I am not in the mood for it  I want a wife who assumes the complete responsibility for birth control  because I do not want more children  I want a wife who will remain *ually faithful to me so that I do not have to clutter5 up my intellectual life with jealousies6  And I want a wife who understands that my *ual needs may entail7 more than strict adherence8 to monogamy  I must  after all  be able to relate to people as fully9 as possible  If  by chance  I find another person more suitable as a wife than the wife I already have  I have the liberty to replace my present wife with another one  Naturally  I will expect a fresh  new life; my wife will take the children and be solely10 responsible for them so that I am left free  When I am through with school and have a job  I want my wife to quit working and remain at home so that my wife can more fully and completely take care of a wife's duties  My God  who wouldn't want a wife
