The shore is an ancient world for as long as there has been an earth and se a there has been this place of the meeting of land and water Yet it is a world that keeps alive the sense of continuing creation and of the relentless1 drive of life Each time that I enter it I gain some new awareness2 of its beauty and it sdeeper meanings sensing that intricate fabric3 of life by which one creature is linked with another and each with its surroundings  In my thoughts of the shore one place stands apart for its revelation of exquisite4 beauty It is a pool hidden within a cave that one can visit only rarely and briefly5 when the lowest of the year's low tides fall below it and perhaps from that very fact it acquires some of its special beauty Choosing such a tide  I hoped for a glimpse of the pool The ebb6 was to fall early in the morning I knew that if the wind held from the northwest and no interfering7 swell8 ran in from a distant storm the level of the sea should drop below the entrance to the pool There had been sudden ominous9 showers in the night with rain like handfuls of gravel10 flung on the roof When I looked out into the early morning the sky was full of a gray dawn light but the sun had not yet risen Water and air were pallid11 Across the bay the moon was a luminous12 disc in the western sky suspended above the dim line of distant shore -- the full August moon drawing the tide to the low low levels of the threshold of the alien sea world As I watched a gull13 flew by above the spruces Its breast was rosy14 with the light of the unrisen sun The day was after all to be fair  Later as I stood above the tide near the entrance to the pool the promise of that rosy light was sustained From the base of the steep wall of rock on which I stood a moss15 covered ledge16 jutted17 seaward into deep water In the surge at the rim18 of the ledge the dark fronds19 of oarweeds swayed smooth and gleaming as leather The projecting ledge was the path to the small hidden cave and its pool Occasionally a swell stronger than the rest rolled smoothly20 over the rim and broke in foam21 against the cliff But the intervals22 between such swells23 were lo ng enough to admit me to the ledge and long enough for a glimpse of that fairy pool so seldom and so briefly exposed  And so I knelt on the wet carpet of sea moss and looked back into the dark cavern24 that held the pool in a shallow basin The floor of the cave was only a fewinches below the roof and a mirror had been created in which all that grew on the ceiling was reflected in the still water below  Under water that was clear as glass the pool was carpeted with green sponge Gray patches of sea squirts glistened25 on the ceiling and colonies of raft coral were a pale apricot color In the moment when I looked into the cave a little e lfin starfish hung down suspended by the merest thread perhaps by only a single tube foot It reached down to touch its own reflection so perfectly26 delineated that there might have been not one starfish but two The beauty of the refle cted images and of the limpid27 pool itself was the poignant28 beauty of things that are ephemeral existing only until the sea should return to fill the little cave
