I was probably one of the few kids in America whose parents didnt want her to go to college Its not that they didnt want me to go exactly now that I look back at it but just as everything else in high school there was the major issue of money My family is very blue collar My parents started having kids very young and I felt they were never able to achieve more than getting a factory job and trying to make ends meet as their family grew While I was growing up it was fine to speak in theoretical terms about going to college I would always say I wanted to go to an Ivy1 League school and then practice neurosurgery at the Mayo Clinic and my dad would say there was absolutely nothing wrong with our state university My aunt Mary the only person in both extended families to go to school before me had gone there and she was a big shot lawyer taking in loads of money So Dad suggested thats what I ought to shoot for The one thing I vividly2 remembered hating in high school was asking for money When my junior year arrived I had signed up for the whole course load of Advanced Placement AP classes Even though the AP tests were only 22 at that time my mom would question why I needed the money and I believe huff a little bit as she wrote out the check I gave creative speeches about how much AP would save me at college and that those 22 would be parlayed into thousands of dollars of tuition money 2222By the time senior year rolled around I sent out only two applications for college one to the state university a little more than two hours away from my hometown and one to a school in another state I was quickly accepted into both but this was the point at which l felt somewhat blindsided by my parents My dad at least seemed to be against the idea of my going away for school He wanted me to attend the extension in our county and save money by continuing to live at home The mere3 thought of staying home another two years was enough to turn my stomach I was already attending some classes at The Stench because my high school didnt offer the accelerated classes I qualified4 for Although it was a fine school and many people did transfer from the extension to the main state school I knew I wouldnt follow that path For whatever reason I had been given more ambition than my parents before me or my two younger brothers both of whom opted5 for the factory scene rather than education But I could see this ambition having an ending point as if it were mistakenly siphoned into me and would be sucked out if I spent too much time in my small town I could see in my minds eye how discouraged I would get living at home for two more years under my parents ironclad rule either getting frustrated6 at the extension or finding more value in the attention from boys ending up pregnant and working at the nearby gas station Not my idea of a future So every day after school my dad and I had blown out fights about where I would go to college His logic7 was very sound especially considering where I stand now three years after graduation with debt up to my eyeballs but I just knew l would get nowhere staying in my hometown He threatened to give me no financial help at all and I said that was fine I would be able to get enough loans Eventually I signed my family up for a tour of the state university My dad and I toured campus and even though it was very cold my dad fell in love or at the very least seemed very enthusiastic about every corner of the campus I could tell he was softened8 by this visit but the fights about where I was going to get the money continued until the day I packed everything up into our minivan It was then at breakfast before we made our journey down that my dad said he was proud of me He hadnt thought I would actually leave and he was impressed As my parents dropped me off at my dorm room my mom started crying hysterically9 and even my dad teared up kissing me on the forehead which was the first time I could remember getting hugged and kissed by them in years At this point my relationship with my parents changed No longer were they the disciplinarians but they became confidants advisors10 and an excellent support system and I became an adult Sometimes I still expect to get yelled at for my decisions but theyve done phenomenally well to leave me to my own life and to just be happy when I actually call home No matter what happens now I know standing11 my ground on where to go for school has been the best decision of my life as I have gained both a good education and a precious life experience I never would have been exposed to had I taken any other road xperience I never would have been exposed to had I taken any other road 	road
