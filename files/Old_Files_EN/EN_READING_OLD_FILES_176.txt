I work at a company where there are about a gazillion employees I cant say that I know them all by name but I know my fair share of them I think that almost all of them know me Id say thats the reason Ive been able to go wherever it is Ive made it to in this world Its all based on one simple principle: I believe every single person deserves to be acknowledged however small or simple the greeting When I was about 10 years old I was walking down the street with my mother She stopped to speak to Mr Lee I was busy trying to bullseye theO in the stop sign with a rock I knew I could see Mr Lee any old time around the neighborhood so I didnt pay any attention to him OAfter we passed Mr Lee my mother stopped me and said something that has stuck with me from that day until now She said You let that be the last time you ever walk by somebody and not open up your mouth to speak because even a dog can wag its tail when it passes you on the street That phrase sounds simple but its been a guidepost for me and the foundation of who I am When you write an essay like this you look in the mirror and see who you are and what makes up your character I realized mine was cemented that day when I was 10 years old Even then I started to see that when I spoke1 to someone they spoke back And that felt good Its not just something I believe in; its become a way of life I believe that every person deserves to feel someone acknowledge their presence no matter how humble2 they may be or even how important At work I always used to say hello to the founder3 of the company and ask him how our business was doing But I was also speaking to the people in the cafe and the people that cleaned the buildings and asked how their children were doing I remembered after a few years of passing by the founder I had the courage to ask him for a meeting We had a great talk At a certain point I asked him how far he thought I could go in his company He said If you want to you can get all the way to this seat Ive become vice4 president but that hasnt changed the way I approach people I still follow my mothers advice I speak to everyone I see no matter where I am Ive learned that speaking to people creates a pathway into their world and it lets them come into mine too The day you speak to someone who has their head held down and when they lift it up and smile you realize how powerful it is just to open your mouth and say Hello alize how powerful it is just to open your mouth and say "Hello "	uing to live at home

	The mere3 thought of staying home another two years was enough to turn my stomach   I was already attending some classes at "The Stench  " because my high school didn't offer the accelerated classes I qualified4 for  Although it was a fine school  and many people did transfer from the extension to the main state school  I knew I wouldn't follow that path

	For whatever reason  I had been given more ambition than my parents before me  or my two younger brothers  both of whom opted5 for the factory scene rather than education  But I could see this ambition having an ending point  as if it were mistakenly siphoned into me and would be sucked out if I spent too much time in my small town  I could see in my mind's eye how discouraged I would get living at home for two more years under my parents' ironclad rule  either getting frustrated6 at the extension  or finding more value in the attention from boys  ending up pregnant and working at the nearby gas station  Not my idea of a future

	So every day after school  my dad and I had blown out fights about where I would go to college  His logic7 was very sound  especially considering where I stand now  three years after graduation with debt up to my eyeballs   but I just knew l would get nowhere staying in my hometown  He threatened to give me no financial help at all  and I said that was fine  I would be able to get enough loans

	Eventually I signed my family up for a tour of the state university  My dad and I toured campus  and even though it was very cold  my dad fell in love - or at the very least seemed very enthusiastic about every corner of the campus

	I could tell he was softened8 by this visit  but the fights about where I was going to get the money continued until the day I packed everything up into our minivan   It was then  at breakfast before we made our journey down  that my dad said he was proud of me  He hadn't thought I would actually leave  and he was impressed  As my parents dropped me off at my dorm room  my mom started crying hysterically9   and even my dad teared up  kissing me on the forehead  which was the first time I could remember getting hugged and kissed by them in years

	At this point  my relationship with my parents changed  No longer were they the disciplinarians but they became confidants   advisors10 and an excellent support system  and I became an adult  Sometimes I still expect to get yelled at for my decisions  but they've done phenomenally well to leave me to my own life  and to just be happy when I actually call home  No matter what happens now  I know standing11 my ground on where to go for school has been the best decision of my life  as I have gained both a good education and a precious life experience I never would have been exposed to had I taken any other road
