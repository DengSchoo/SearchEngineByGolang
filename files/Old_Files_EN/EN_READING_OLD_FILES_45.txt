You dont marry a man you marry a lifestyle Who you marry has the largest impact not just on your emotional life but also on your lifestyle Both the large and small things in your daily life and long term plans will be impacted by your significant others likes dislikes habits schedule health personality moods job stresses financial security family and situation taLucky for me I married my best friend and someone who fits my lifestyle Jay Wacker who loves to travel cook watch Game of Thrones take pictures and who can be silly and serious You can make any choice you want if you are willing to accept the consequences that come with it When I was a little girl my mother told me that if you want to know whether a person is really nice observe the way that person treats salesclerks waiters and other people in service professions who cant defend themselves She was 100 correct and Ive never forgotten it It is very useful in sorting people out Right before I walked down the aisle1 to marry her son my motherinlaw told me Michelle if a man cant make himself a sandwich he should starve man can't make himself a sandwich he should starve "	on difference has never been any kind of issue 	17	 	In fact it's pretty clear that his degree has been more practically2 useful 		 	Would I date someone with less intellectual3 curiosity4 than me 		 	Probably not because I think once that was established we'd find out we had little in common to sustain5 a relationship beyond a friendship 		 	It's not that I'd think less of them 		 	These are just the kind of judgments6 we make when sorting out what kind of relationships we want with people 	 more important what you know or who you know It seems that by working hard and making lots of connections the answer may be that both are very important   some will hurt you  some will inspire you to do better. At the same time  you are playing some role in their lives as well. Know that paths cross for a reason and treat people with significance.

	There is no better joy then helping1 people see a vision for themselves, seeing them go to levels higher than they ever would have imagined on their own. But that doesn't mean you have to fix them or enable them; instead, guide them to the source of their own power. Offer them support and motivation as they find their own way and show you what they're capable of. All you have to do is believe in them.

	We like to think of life as a meritocracy, so it's easy to look down on someone who isn't as successful or accomplished2 or well educated as you are. But you have no idea how far that person has already climbed or where they will end up. Time could easily reverse your positions, so be sure you treat everyone with dignity.
