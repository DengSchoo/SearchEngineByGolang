One day  an expert in time management was speaking to a group of students and  to drive home a point  used an illustration those students will never forget  As he stood in front of the group of overachievers he said  "OK  time for a quiz " He pulled out a one-gallon  wide-mouth jar and set it on the table in front of him  He also produced about a dozen fist-sized rocks and carefully placed them  one at a time  into the jar  When the jar was filled to the top and no more rocks would fit inside  he asked  "Is this jar full " Everyone in the class yelled  "Yes " The time management expert replied  "Really " He reached under the table and pulled out a bucket of gravel1  He dumped some gravel in and shook the jar  causing pieces of gravel to work themselves down into the spaces between the big rocks  He then asked the group once more  "Is this jar full " By this time the class was on to him  "Probably not " one of them answered  "Good " he replied  He reached under the table and brought out a bucket of sand  He started dumping the sand in the jar and it went into all of the spaces left between the rocks and the gravel  Once more he asked the question  "Is this jar full " "No " the class shouted  Once again he said  "Good " Then he grabbed a pitcher2 of water and began to pour it in until the jar was filled to the brim  Then he looked at the class and asked  "What is the point of this illustration " One eager student raised his hand and said  "The point is  no matter how full your schedule is  if you try really hard you can always fit some more things in it " "No " the speaker replied  "that's not the point  The truth this illustration teaches us is if you don't put the big rocks in first  you'll never get them in at all  What are the 'big rocks' in your life  Time with your loved ones  your education  your dreams  a worthy3 cause  teaching or mentoring4 others  Remember to put these big rocks in first or you'll never get them in at all "
