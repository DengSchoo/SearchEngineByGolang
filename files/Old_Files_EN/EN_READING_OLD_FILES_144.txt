	Eventually I signed my family up for a tour of the state university  My dad and I toured campus  and even though it was very cold  my dad fell in love - or at the very least seemed very enthusiastic about every corner of the campus

	I could tell he was softened8 by this visit  but the fights about where I was going to get the money continued until the day I packed everything up into our minivan   It was then  at breakfast before we made our journey down  that my dad said he was proud of me  He hadn't thought I would actually leave  and he was impressed  As my parents dropped me off at my dorm room  my mom started crying hysterically9   and even my dad teared up  kissing me on the forehead  which was the first time I could remember getting hugged and kissed by them in years

	At this point  my relationship with my parents changed  No longer were they the disciplinarians but they became confidants   advisors10 and an excellent support system  and I became an adult  Sometimes I still expect to get yelled at for my decisions  but they've done phenomenally well to leave me to my own life  and to just be happy when I actually call home  No matter what happens now  I know standing11 my ground on where to go for school has been the best decision of my life  as I have gained both a good education and a precious life experience I never would have been exposed to had I taken any other road
