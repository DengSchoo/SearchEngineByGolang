If I knew it would be the last time I'd see you fall asleep  I would tuck you in more tightly and "pray the lord your soul to keep"  If I knew it would be the last time I'd see you walk out the door  I would give you a hug and kiss you and call you back for more  If I knew it would be the last time I'd hear your voice lifted up in praise  I would video tape each action and word so I could play them back day after day  If I knew it would be the last time I could spare an extra minute or so to stop and say"I love you "instead of assuming you would know I do  If I knew it would be the last time I would be there so share you day  I'm sure you'll have so many more so I can let just this one slip away  For surely there's slways tomorrow to make up for an oversight1 and certainly there's another chance to make everthing right  There will always be another day to say "I love you" and certainly there's another chance to say our"anything I can do " But just in case I might be wrong and today is all I get  I'd like to say how much I love you and I hope we never forget  Tomorrow is not promised to anyone young or old alike and today may be the last chance you get to hold your love tight  So if you'er waiting for tomorrow why not do it today  For if tomorrow never comes you'll surely regret the day  That you didn't take that extra time for a smile a huge or a kiss and you were too busy to grant someone what turned out to be their one last wish  So hold your loved ones close today and whisper in their ear that you love them very much and you'll always hold them dear  Take time to say"I'm sorry" "please forgive me" "thank you"or""it's okay  And if tomorrow never comes you'll have no regrets about today ay heir profound secret but the day did come One of the darkest days that ever pass through a son He stood with his father over his mother's casket Slowly tenderly the father stretched forth7 a hand and raised the thick reddish brown hair to reveal the mother had no outer ears  "Mother said she was glad she never let her hair be cut " his father whispered gently "and nobody ever thought mother less beautiful did they " REMEMBER   Real beauty lies not in the physical appearance  but in the heart  Real treasure lies not in what can be seen  but what cannot be seen  Real love lies not in what is done and known  but in what that is done but not known f-control and a weak will  
	 
	6  Your punctuality 
	 
	How early or late you show up for an appointment or a meeting could form an impression  either negative or positive  about your personality  Being late for an important date means you are creating a negative impression about who you are  while being early for an appointment means you are considerate about other people's time  and are both mentally organized and self-motivated
