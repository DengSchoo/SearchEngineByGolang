Well you can Only you might find yourself staying at a Trave Lodge1 driving a rented Ford2 Contour and staking out your childhood home like some noir private eye just trying to catch a glimpse of the Johnny-come-latelys that are now living in YOUR HOUSE  It's a familiar story Kids grow up parents sell the family home and move to some sunnier climate some condo somewhere some smaller abode3 We grown up kids box up all the junk from our childhoods -- dusty ballet shoes high school text books rolled up posters of Adam Ant -- and wonder where home went  I'm not a sentimental4 person I told myself I don't need to see old 3922 26th Street before we sell the place I even skipped the part where I return home to salvage5 my mementos6 from the garage I let my parents box up the stuff which arrived from San Francisco like the little package you get when released from jail You know here's your watch the outfit7 you wore in here some cash Here's the person you once were  After a year San Francisco called me home again I missed it I cruised over to my old neighborhood There was the little corner store my mom used to send me to for milk the familiar fire station the Laundromat  I cried like the sap I never thought I'd be I sat in the car staring at my old house tears welling up  I walked up and touched the doorknob like it was the cheek of a lover just home from war I sat on our scratchy brick stoop dangling8 my legs off the edge feeling as rootless as I've ever felt  As much as I'd like to buy the cliches about home being where the heart is or as Robert Frost put it "The place where when you have to go there they have to take you in " a part of me thinks the truth is somewhere between the loftiness of all those platitudes9 and the concreteness of that wooden door on 26th street  I'll probably be casing that joint10 from time to time for the rest of my life I'll sit outside like a child watching someone take away a favorite toy and silently scream "MINE "king apple is harbouring a worm in the bud  But the orange had no secret faults  Its outside is a mirror of its inside  and if you are quick you can tell the shopman so before he slips it into the bag
