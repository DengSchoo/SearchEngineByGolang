Theres no doubt that I have a sweet tooth I crave1 cakes and biscuits and could happily finish off a bar of chocolate in minutes Im sure Im not alone the sweet sugary taste is addictive2 but the big question is is it bad for me I think I know the answer Sugar is everywhere Even if sweet stuff isnt your thing its hard to avoid In the UK we consume over two million tonnes of sugar every year but often we dont know were eating it There have been many health campaigns telling us about the dangers of consuming too much sugar and we have probably learnt that it should be eaten in moderation but we may be unaware3 of the added sugar we consume thats found in the food and drink we think of as healthy or savoury such as lowfat yoghurt and sauces The obvious negative effect of eating sugar is on our dental health tooth decay is a big problem in children partly caused by drinking too many sugary drinks Public Health England claims a child in England has a tooth removed in hospital every 10 minutes due to preventable decay But even if you can escape the dentists drill there are more worrying negative effects repeatedly eating too much sugar can lead to weight gain and even obesity4 leading to an increased risk of diabetes5 heart disease and liver disease So what can we do to cut down on our sugar intake6 Well there are lowsugar recipes you can try and apparently7 there are alternative foods to help us beat the sweet cravings But potentially the most effective method is to tax the sugar we consume Its what several countries have been doing for a while and the UK has recently jumped on the bandwagon by forcing manufacturers to pay a levy8 on the highsugar drinks they sell Its up to the manufacturers if they pass the cost on to consumers But will it work University of Bedfordshire nutrition expert Dr Daniel Bailey told BBC Online that: The increase in tax placed on soft drinks will make products more expensive but will this actually discourage people from buying them Maybe if youre addicted9 to the stuff youd accept paying more to buy it But in the UK at least several soft drinks companies have already reduced the sugar content of their products to avoid the tax Obviously its better to do something rather than nothing to help improve the wellbeing10 of everyone But with so many temptations out there Im not sure how easy it will be to cure my sweet tooth ure how easy it will be to cure my sweet tooth h erry notes, intensive green aroma5 of violet leaf and sparkling spicy6 pink grapefruit.

	Daisy reminds me of the summers I spend at my grandparents' house as a little girl. I have a memory of going outside to play and being hit with that delicious smell of freshly cut grass. You know that watery12 green smell? That's what Daisy smells like to me.	Daisy reminds me of the summers I spend at my grandparents' house as a little girl.

	I smell Daisy now and I am taken back to spring/summer 2015 when I wore the heck out of my bottle. I repurchased another full size that summer when I reached the halfway14 point of the bottle I was using. That's how much I loved it. I was close to finishing my bottle when all of a sudden, I grew tired of it. I think I may have worn it too much and it ended up boring me. I finished my bottle and haven't touched my backup until recently. I decided15 to revisit Daisy and fell in love again. Daisy is easy to like but can easily get boring. Next time I'll make sure not to wear it so often to keep this fragrance interesting.	I smell Daisy now and I am taken back to spring/summer 2015 when I wore the heck out of my bottle.
