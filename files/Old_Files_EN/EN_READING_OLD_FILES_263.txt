Once President Roosevelt's house was broken into and lots of things were stolen Hearing this one of Roosevelt's friends wrote to him and advised him not to take it to his heart so much  President Roosevelt wrote back immediately saying "Dear friend thank you for your letter to comfort me  I'm all right now  I think I should thank God This is because of the following three reasons: firstly the thief only stole things from me but did not hurt me at all; secondly1 the thief has stolen some of my things instead of all my things; thirdly most luckily for me it was the man rather than me who became a thief" It was quite unlucky for anyone to be stolen from However President Roosevelt had such three reasons to be so grateful This story tells us how we can learn to be grateful in our life  Being grateful is an important philosophy of life and a great wisdom It is impossible for anyone to be lucky and successful all the time so long as he lives in the world Smile and so will it when you cry to it If you are grateful to life it will bring you shining sunlight   We should learn how to face failure or misfortune2 bravely and generously and to try to deal with it  If so should we complain about our life and become frustrated3 and disappointed ever since then or should we be grateful for our life rise again ourselves after a fall  If you always complain about everything you may own nothing in the end  When we are successful we can surely have many reasons for being grateful but we have only one excuse to show ungratefulness if we fail  I think we should even be grateful to life whenever we are unsuccessful or unlucky Only by doing this can we find our weakness and shortcomings when we fail We can also get relief and warmth when we are unlucky This can help us find our courage to overcome the difficulties we may face and receive great impetus4 to move on We should treat our frustration5 and misfortune in our life in the other way just as President Roosevelt did  We should be grateful all the time and keep having a healthy attitude to our life forever keep having perfect characters and enterprising spirit Being grateful is not only a kind of comfort not an escape from life and nor thinking of winning in spirit like Ah Q Being grateful is a way to sing for our life which comes just from our love and hope   When we put a small piece of alum into muddy water we can see the alum can soon make the water clear If each of us has an attitude of being grateful we'll be able to get rid of impulse6 upset dissatisfaction and misfortune  Being grateful can bring us a better and more beautiful life  her hand  if you say you're not good at a certain job  but your actions say otherwise  that's also important  What do you do with this insight  You can use it to make more beneficial choices in your life  By being honest with yourself based on your previous actions  your actions moving forward will be based on truth instead of just what you tell yourself  Take time out during the day for quiet time to listen to your inner voice  I call this inner voice the voice of God  This is similar to point number one  but it takes it a step further - beyond the natural mind to the supernatural heart  You may want to use your quiet time to meditate6 or pray  However you use this time  the key is to shut out all of the noise around you by focusing deep within yourself  Breathing deeply during quiet time will also help you focus  I know it's hard to find quiet time during a particularly busy day  but it's so important - even if it's just 10 minutes a day and you have to sneak7 away to get it  Quiet time can really make a difference in your life  It enables you to hear God speaking to your heart reminding you of His perfect love for you  Despite what your subconscious8 may be telling you  you can have love with no limits  The key is to unconditionally love yourself first t short now  just like yours was all those years ago  When I met her at the door her smile wrapped around me like a warm glove  just like yours used to do  my darling  I know you are tired  my dear  and I must let you go  But I love you so much it hurts to do so  As we grew old together  I would tease you that you had not changed since we first met  But it is true  my darling  I do not see the wrinkles and grey hair that other people see  When I look at you now  I only see your sweet tender lips and youthful sparkling eyes as we sat and had out first picnic next to that small stream  and chased each other around that big old oak tree  I remember wishing those first few days together would last forever  Do you remember how exciting and wonderful those days were  I must go now  my darling  Our children are waiting outside  They want to say goodbye to you  I wipe the tears away from my eyes and bend my frail14 old legs down to the floor  so that I can kneel beside you  I lean close to you and take hold of your hand and kiss your tender lips for the very last time  Sleep peacefully my dear  I am sad that you had to leave me  but please don't worry  I am content  knowing I will be with you soon  I am too old and too empty now to live much longer without you  I know it won't be long before we meet again in that small café in Hanover Square  Goodbye  my darling wife
