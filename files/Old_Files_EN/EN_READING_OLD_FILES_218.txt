Sarah and I met in college and instantly fell into an intense sisterly friendship I thought I would know her forever After college our lives diverged1 I moved to New York City and started a career Sarah moved back home down south got married and had kids way before I did As the years passed we had less and less in common it seemed I drifted farther and farther away I stopped answering her calls I was too young to understand that old friends are the ones who can remind you of who you once were I was too young to know that while we may grow up and shed our younger selves like snakes molting2 skin those selves are still important and we should keep close those who knew us when and remind us of the distance weve traveled I didnt yet know that there are many aspects of a friendship far more important than sharing a career a neighborhood a kids school a life path Sarah and I were connected on a level deeper than all that and the fact that Im not going to be pulling up my rocking chair next to hers in a nursing home some day makes me sad I blew it Sarah if youre reading this Im sorry ing this I'm sorry ain Mrs P " she called "We'll have another happy day "	 	The days and weeks that followed belong to others: a group of unruly Boy Scouts5 PTA meetings and ailing6 mother The sun was shining one morning as I took my hands out of the dishwater "I need a sandpiper " I said to myself gathering7 up my coat The ever-changing balm of the seashore awaited me 	 	The breeze was chilly8 but I strode along trying to recapture the serenity9 I needed I had forgotten the child and was startled when she appeared 	 	"Hello Mrs P " she said "Do you want to play "	 	"What did you have in mind " I asked with a twinge of annoyance10 	 	"I don't know you say "	 	"How about charades11 " I asked sarcastically12 	 	The tinkling13 laughter burst forth14 again "I don't know what that is "	 	"Then let's just walk " Looking at her I noticed the delicate fairness	 	of her face "Where do you live " I asked 	 	"Over there " She pointed15 toward a row of summer cottages Strange I thought in winter 	 	"Where do you go to school "	 	"I don't go to school Mommy says we're on vacation " She chattered16 little girl talk as we strolled up the beach but my mind was on other things When I left for home Wendy said it had been a happy day 	 	Feeling surprisingly better I smiled at her and agreed Three weeks later I rushed to my beach in a state of near panic I was in no mood to even greet Wendy I thought I saw her mother on the porch and felt like demanding she keep her child at home 	 	"Look if you don't mind " I said crossly when Wendy caught up with me "I'd rather be alone today "	 	She seems unusually pale and out of breath 	 	"Why " she asked 	 	I turned to her and shouted "Because my mother died " and thought my God why was I saying this to a little child 	 	"Oh " she said quietly "then this is a bad day "	 	"Yes and yesterday and the day before and-oh go away "	 	"Did it hurt "	 	"Did what hurt " I was exasperated17 with her with myself 	 	"When she died " "Of course it hurt " I snapped misunderstanding wrapped up in myself I strode off 	 	A month or so after that when I next went to the beach she wasn't there Feeling guilty ashamed and admitting to myself I missed her I went up to the cottage after my walk and knocked at the door A drawn18 looking young woman with honey-colored hair opened the door #p##e#	 	"Hello " I said "I'm Ruth Peterson I missed your little girl today and wondered where she was "	 	"Oh yes Mrs Peterson please come in" "Wendy talked of you so much 	 	I'm afraid I allowed her to bother you If she was a nuisance please accept my apologies "	 	"Not at all-she's a delightful19 child " I said suddenly realizing that I meant it "Where is she "	 	"Wendy died last week Mrs Peterson She had leukemia Maybe she didn't tell you " Struck dumb I groped for a chair My breath caught 	 	"She loved this beach; so when she asked to come we couldn't say no 	 	She seemed so much better here and had a lot of what she called happy days But the last few weeks she declined rapidly  " her voice faltered20 	 	"She left something for you  if only I can find it Could you wait a moment while I look "	 	I nodded stupidly my mind racing21 for something anything to say to this lovely young woman She handed me a smeared22 envelope with MRS P printed in bold childish letters Inside was a drawing in bright crayon hues-a yellow beach a blue sea and a brown bird Underneath23 was carefully printed: A SANDPIPER TO BRING YOU JOY	 	Tears welled up in my eyes and a heart that had almost forgotten to love opened wide I took Wendy's mother in my arms "I'm so sorry I'm sorry I'm so sorry " I muttered over and over and we wept together 	 	The precious little picture is framed now and hangs in my study Six words- one for each year of her life- that speak to me of harmony courage undemanding love A gift from a child with sea-blue eyes and hair the color sand--- who taught me the gift of love
