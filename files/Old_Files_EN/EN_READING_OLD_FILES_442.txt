There is something wrong with us  We are plagued by feelings of inadequateness and worthlessness postponing1 self-acceptance and self-love until a day in the future when we're thinner wealthier more confident and more popular  You are perfect and complete exactly as you are Even when you are striving to improve and grow you are complete As the Buddhist2 saying goes "We are all perfect as we are and we could all use a little work " It matters what other people think of us  We give away so much of our energy power and inner peace by worrying about what others think of us  The truth is we can't ever know for certain what other people are thinking about us So when your ego3 starts to fill you with doubt and fear remember it's a fictional4 story  Holding grudges5 is a natural part of life  When we feel that someone has "wronged" us we cling to the memory and carry it around with us for weeks or sometimes years What we fail to realize is that we are holding ourselves hostage not just the perceived wrong-doer  The Buddha6 once said "Holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else; you are the one who gets burned " Make forgiveness your new motto and see how much freer and lighter7 your soul feels  We see things how they really are  How we experience the world is heavily influenced by our beliefs and past experiences  Our subconscious8 mind chooses pieces of information to serve to our conscious mind based on what we've programmed it to look for Identify your dominant9 beliefs and replace the ones that aren't serving you  Meditation10 is something people do on a cushion at sunrise  You can meditate11 and be mindful all throughout the day as you go about your life  Pause and feel the weight of your body in your seat the feeling of the fabric12 against your skin and the slight sensation of the air on your face  Take a few deep breaths and let your whole being relax Scan your body up and down for sensations simply observing without making any judgments13  When we give something we lose something  Giving and receiving are one in truth When you give to someone with no strings14 attached -- whether it be a physical gift a compliment or your time -- you are nourished as well as the receiver  Not only do you experience sensations of satisfaction and joy but your karma will bring more blessings15 and gifts back into your life  We have to logically figure everything out  We've been taught to trust our minds but not our intuition or inner voice of guidance  When you're grappling with a problem or lacking clarity learn to lean into your soul and trust the wisdom it provides to you -- often in the form of a gut16 feeling serendipitous17 sign or a spontaneous "aha " moment  We need to be more realistic  Many people think that daily happiness and joy is an unrealistic goal and we should be more realistic  Happiness is THE ultimate goal of our lives and it is both worthwhile and attainable18  Understand your purpose is to blossom into the highest happiest version of you and let go of any guilt19 you feel for making your happiness a priority
