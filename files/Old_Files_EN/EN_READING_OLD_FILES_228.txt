1 Leave your cars at homeCars being the greatest source of air pollution can be left at home this weekend Travelling via public transport is the better option Other greener options are carpooling riding a bike or you can also walk if you want a healthier option and if your workplace is not that far away from your home 2 Be a little dirtyNo we dont mean it that way We simply mean to say dont take a bath Yes conservation of water is super essential A day or two without a bath wont harm you but it will certainly do a lot of good for our planet1 A daily shower isnt a matter of health; its a matter of comfort Showering every day can wash away the natural oils that our skin and hair need 3 Volunteer yourselfThis is one of the best things you can do Why Because it will do you good too Join other likeminded individuals in a common task If you have the time there are lots of opportunities out there to pitch in for instance2 planting trees cleaning a park or simply coming up with ways you can preserve mother Earth 4 Greenup your homeThis is one of the most common things that people do whenever Earth Day rolls around that is switch off their lights However this is not something you should do just for a day and for only an hour Conserve3 energy by switching of all power andor electricity points whenever they are not in use In addition take out all the plugs from plug points even after switching them off 5 Pledge4 to do more everydayYou know what the best way to celebrate Earth Day is Extend5 your celebrations Thats right Do something everyday that will improve your surroundings6 to make the planet a better place to live in Always remember that every step every initiative7 counts The future of our planet is in your hands ative7 counts  	 	The future of our planet is in your hands - my mother - reclines Mom is spread out in the chair like thick sweet frosting on a cake Languid her arms raised above her head her legs splayed pant legs rolled up to expose a goodly length of pale skin Her arms are bare the undersides pasty in comparison to the tops Her smile in repose16 is tender sweet unassuming and peaceful 	 	To my knowledge Mom never owned a bathing suit I don't recall ever seeing her step into the lake and never before had she sunbathed17 That day however was different It was as if all her cares had floated out to deep waters like the unattended beach ball had done just minutes before 	 	We are a large family When my siblings18 and I were young Dad was the one who took us to the beach He sat in the car and watched as we frolicked in the shallows Mom stayed home to ensure we had a hot meal when we returned Perhaps Mom was happy for the few moments of alone time at home in the kitchen as was Dad alone in the car 	 	On this day their grown children with children of our own treat them to dinner on the beach Dad fishes off the dock never swaying from his pleasantries And for once Mom forgets about making dinner 	 	It is a day of memories a day never to be forgotten 	 	My three children are in the photo and Dad is in the background as are two of my sisters and their children but everyone who gazes at the poorly developed photo is drawn19 inexplicably20 to Mom's smile In the photo her face is raised up to the sky To the sun or to our Creator she alone knows Her eyes are closed 	 	I remember how warm it was that day and how she had squinted21 up at me shielding her eyes with both hands 	 	"Are my legs getting red " she'd asked 	 	My eyes brim with unshed tears as I remember the feel of her skin on the palm of my hand Hot The scalding tears run down my face How I wish I could touch her one more time 	 	"No Mom " I replied "But better put some sunscreen on before you get a burn " Reluctantly she'd sat up the peaceful smile disappearing and rolled her pant legs down again 	 	"Save it for the kids " she said her eyes scanning the group of children splashing in and out of the water The whisper of a smile touched her lips as she watched for a long wistful moment With a sigh she rose from the chair and moved toward the car where the coolers awaited 	 	"Maybe we should get lunch going " she said as she opened the first cooler 	 	Now it is my turn to smile Mom was not ready to relinquish22 dinner duties after all On a whim23 I turn my face heavenward and close my eyes I draw a deep breath and search for the special place Mom found that afternoon It comes to me easily Without pomp or ceremony there she is smiling again Tears squeeze from beneath my closed lids and I fervently24 pray that anyone who might come upon me at this moment will say my smile reminds them of Mom's smile that day on the beach so long ago Tender sweet unassuming - and despite our loss it was peaceful
