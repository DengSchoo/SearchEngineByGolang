Imagine that your feelings are a child within If you ignore this child - by ignoring your feelings - this child feels abandoned Our refusal to feel and take responsibility for our own pain is an inner abandonment and results in anxiety depression or inner emptiness  Learning to manage the pain of loneliness is essential to discovering your passion and purpose There is no way of managing loneliness without a deep and personal connection to a spiritual source of love and wisdom We cannot manage loneliness from our mind alone  It is our child within: our feeling self that has the blueprint1 for what has meaning for us for our passion and purpose Each of us comes to this planet with a deep purpose to express and when we don't express this purpose we end up feeling empty and depressed2 Yet we cannot discover this purpose when we keep a lid on our feelings  You will find deep meaning in your life when you decide to open to and learn from your feelings of loneliness rather than continue to shut them down And you will open to these feelings only when you do not feel alone inside due to experiencing the love and wisdom of your spiritual Guidance Opening to divine Love and opening to your feelings will bring you the fullness joy passion and purpose that are the yearnings of your soul d evils  When my dream comes true  all men will be truly equal  happy  and free
