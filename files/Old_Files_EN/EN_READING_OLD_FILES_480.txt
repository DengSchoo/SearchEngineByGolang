How many times have you heard the expression that most people spend more time planning their vacation than they do planning their lives I would expand that expression by adding that most people spend more time "thinking" about their vacation than they do thinking about what's important in their life  While rest and relaxation1 are a must in living a balanced life it's not what we were created to do After all the Master Creator took his R&R (Rest and Recreation) on the seventh day only after six days of "definitely directed thought " Wallace D Wattles wrote "There is no labor2 from which most people shrink as they do from that of sustained and consecutive3 thought; it is the hardestwork in the world " And yet it is the first and primary labor of achievement  What is your life's purpose or your personal mission statement Is it written down Do you review it and think about it often Is your life organized around your purpose and a set of goals that support that purpose  Without purpose and goals - definitely directed thought - you are like the proverbial "ship without a rudder " There is power in your purpose and in your goals It is the power that takes you over obstacles the fuel that propels you toward the life you envision e accordingly saving your emotinal energy for disasters  and the book of events is never more than half open ality: you might just as well be dead
