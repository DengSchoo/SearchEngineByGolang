You must study to be frank with the world:frankness is the child of honesty and courage Say just what you mean to do on every occasion If a friend asks a favor you should grant it if it is reasonable; if not tell him plainly why you cannot You would wrong him and wrong yourself by equivocation1 of any kind  Never do a wrong thing to make a friend or keep one The man who requires you to do so is dearly purchased at a sacrifice Deal kindly2 but firmly with all your classmates You will find it the policy which wears best Above all do not appear to others what you are not  If you have any fault to find with any one tell him not others of what you complain There is no more dangerous experiment than that of undertaking3 to do one thing before a man's face and another behind his back We should say and do nothing to the injury of any one It is not only a matter of principle but also the path of peace and hornor ve me please don't comfort me because each sewing has to meet stinging3 pain  Don't forget the things you once you owned Treasure the things you can't get Don't give up the things that belong to you and keep those lost things in memory mmended by the Fair (WeChat Subscription) touched me: by hard work  ordinary people only fight for the right to continue their ordinary life in the ordinary world  It is cruel  but it is true (at least in my opinion)  The best solution is to accept and enjoy it  I know it's hard but this is a part of growing up  I'm not saying that we should not be ambitious2 or have great dreams  after all  just as Vince Lombardi has said  "Perfection3 is not attainable4  but if we chase5 perfection we can catch excellence6"  However  I just think we should get prepared if our great dreams would never come true  I also had dreamt about becoming extraordinary at a young age  same as most of my fellow classmates in primary school  In the senior high school  I was no longer one of the top students  and then  for the very first time  I recognized that maybe I couldn t be extraordinary  Now  I'm well aware that I'm no more than an ordinary person but I'm happy with that  I went to an ordinary university and got my BA in English  then to another ordinary university and received my MA in translation and interpreting7  Doing the editor's job  I now earn myself a life in Shanghai  such an expensive metropolitan8 city to live in (and I'm not a local girl)  I can't afford Michael Kors or Issey Miyake  but I have comfortable clothes which fit me well  I usually go out dinner with a couple of friends on weekends  not fancy9 or first class restaurants but sidewalk café or common restaurants where we know there are delicious food and nice service  I consider this not the passive10 acceptance11  but an optimistic attitude of turning "this is life" to "this is the life"  But all in all  I still have dreams  just in case they would become true one day  Yes  be ordinary and be happy
