What did you want to be when you were growing up A teacher A doctor An astronaut What do you need to do to achieve your dream job Perhaps you think that studying well and then going on to work hard will get you the career you want We are constantly1 taught that our hard work will eventually pay off But a government survey has shown that hard work is not the only thing that will help you to move up the ladder Two thirds of people believe that who you know matters more than what you know when it comes to social mobility2 So are the connections that you have more important than your education Seventy six per cent of people in the survey believed that family background is important in influencing your chances of success They believe that if you are privileged3 from birth you are more likely to have a successful career especially if your family is wealthy Are some people just handed life on a plate Even if you dont have a privileged background the people you know can still make a difference to your career Networking is a skill which is encouraged by many careers advisers4 Some companies run networking workshops to try and encourage staff to meet other people to communicate and build relationships Its a valuable skill But the survey also revealed5 something quite interesting Although most people believed that networks are more important than education many people put their own career success down to talent rather than background 41 of people said that their parents income had influenced their life but at the same time another 41 believed that they had engineered their own success So which is the more important what you know or who you know It seems that by working hard and making lots of connections the answer may be that both are very important that both are very important er is full you're getting the most bang for your buck11 when it comes to the water you're using And always make sure that you have enough dirty clothing for a full load 	 	6 Use water-efficient appliances 	 	The next time you need to replace a dishwasher washing machine or water heater purchase a water-efficient appliance Not only will this cut back on your water consumption but you'll save money over time when it comes to utility costs 	 	7 Avoid washing your car or use a bucket 	 	Put the hose down and let the rain clean your car for you If you do feel the need to wash your vehicle fill a few buckets instead of using your garden hose to clean your vehicle off and rinse6 it If you use a hose to wash your vehicle you'll use roughly 190 L of water A few buckets will only require 1938 L though d is awful and publishing contracts are complicated, so many authors employ an agent to negotiate a deal with a publisher.
