Love is like a fourseason gardenA relationship is like a garden if it is to strive it must be watered regularly special care must be given; take into account the seasons as well as any unpredictable weather New seeds must be sown and weeds must be pulled Similarly to keep the magic of love alive we must understand its seasons and nurture1 loves special needs The springtime of loveFalling in love is like springtime We feel as though we will be happy forever We cant image not loving a partner It is a time of innocence2 Love seems eternal It is a magic time when everything seems perfect and works effortlessly Our partner seems to be the perfect fit We effortless dance together in harmony and rejoice our good fortune The summer of loveThroughout the summer of love we realize our partner is not as perfect as we thought And we have to work on our relationship not only is our partner from other planet but he or she is also a human who makes mistakes and flawed in certain ways Frustration3 and disappointment arise Weeds need to be uprooted4 and plant need extra watering under the hot sun It is no longer easy to give love and get the love we need We discover that we are not always happy and we do not always feel loving It is not our picture of love Many couples at this point become disillusioned5 They do not want to work on a relationship They unrealistically expect it to be spring all the time They blame their partners and give up They do not realize that love is not always easy; sometimes requires hard work under a hot sun In the summer season of love we need to nurture our partner needs as well as ask for and get the love we need It doesnt happen automatically The autumn of loveAs result of tending the garden during the summer we get to harvest results of our hard work Fall has come It is a golden time rich and fulfilling We experience a more mature love that accepts and understands our partners imperfections as well as our own It is a time of thanksgiving and sharing Having worked hard during the summer we can relax and enjoy the love we have created The winter of loveThen weather changes again and winter comes During the cold barren months of winter all of our nature pulls back within itself It is a time of rest reflection and renewal6 It is a time and relationships we experience only unresolved pain or our shadow self It is when our lid comes off and our painful feeling emerge It is a time of solitary7 growth when who need to look more to ourselves than to our partners for love and fulfillment It is a time of healing This is the time when men hibernate8 in their caves and women sink to the bottom of their wells After loving and healing ourselves through the dark winter of love then spring inevitably9 returns Once again we are blessed with the feeling of hope love and an abundance of possibilities Based on our inner healing and soul searching of our winter journey we are then able to open our hearts and feel springtime of love en able to open our hearts and feel springtime of love 	 		 		 		 		 		 		 	 	 		 		 		 		 	wnspeople  That's what I felt like doing about the tree  I wanted to become a Paul Revere15 of autumn  awakening16 the countryside to its wonder

	I am a fully4 participating member of society these days  My horses and I made it through a master's degree and then law school  I am a practicing attorney  I even make court appearances  I may have made it otherwise  but I'm not sure  I feel I owe my life to the horse and I try to give it back to them every day  I am fortunate that I can look out my back door and see my beautiful horses looking back at me  I am so grateful that I get to watch them run in their mountain pasture every day  I hope I never stop learning from them  They have given me the best gift I could ever imagine  my life
