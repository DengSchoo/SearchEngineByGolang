No matter how busy you are you could spend five minutes: To answer the telephone To read the morning paper To talk with a neighbor To dispute with the laundryman about a mistake To watch new furniture being unloaded next door To chat with a salesman To read a trivial letter Or to write one It takes only five minutes: To say a prayer for the suffering friend To stop and think of God's daily gift of mercy To remember the cross To make an act of faith hope and love To whisper an "our Father" or "Hail Mary" for someone in need To say a decade of the Rosary for the pour souls To vist the little statue or picture on the mantle1 place and tell the Savior how much you love him To make a spiritual communion Which is the better way to spend five minutes themselves disagreeable everywhere If this turn of mind were founded in nature such unhappy persons would be more to be pitied The tendency to criticize and be disgusted is perhaps taken up originally by imitation It grows into a habit unknown to its possessors The habit may be strong but it may be cured when those who have it are convinced of its bad effects on their interests and tastes  Although in fact it is chiefly an act of imagination it has serious consequence in life since it brings on deep sorrow and bad luck Those people offend many others nobody loves them and no one treats them with more than the most common politeness and respect and scarcely that This frequently puts them in bad temper and draws them into arguments If they aim at obtaining some advantage in rank or fortune nobody wishes them success If they bring on themselves public disapproval2 no one will defend or excuse them and many will join to criticize their misconduct These people should change this bad habit and condescend3 to be pleased with what is pleasing without worrying needlessly about themselves and others If they do not it will be good for others to avoid any contact with them
