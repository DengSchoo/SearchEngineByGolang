	Hi I'm Bonnie I'm from Teleflora I have a special delivery1 from your son Ryan that he really wants you to see 	Teleflora	Hi mom Happy Mother's Day 		I wanna let you know how much I love you and I appreciate everything that you've done for me in my life 		The distance between us is not always easy It's actually pretty hard sometimes 		I still remember the last time we saw each other It was almost two years ago 		I was passing through Santiago on my way out to Japan and you drove 2 hours just sit down and have coffee with me for 45 minutes 	45	Just discussing what's going on in our lives before I had to get on my flight continue on 		I miss you It's been hard 		Growing up it was just the two of us you had all the responsibility of raising young boy into a man you could be proud of 		You give me so much I didn't know how much you have sacrificed to until I was an adult at college 		Now I have learnt it You had a dream to become a professional athlete and then you got pregnant2 with me You had to choose 		You knew you could't do both and you gave it up to raise me 		To raise me in the best way that you knew how and you still do to me that sacrifice and that dedication3 		And you gave me everything that you had I realized how hard it was Thank you very much 		The discipline the love the support the understanding that you gave me I think all the thing you did for me 		I look at my children If I can just do half of what you did they will be so much better off 		You were a guiding light for me I've taken in everything that you've given me and I run with it 		Because of you I stand here today A father a husband a navy4 commander It's because of you 		You show me how to work and not quit have honor5 have integrity6 		I've achieved all these things because the foundation7 that you laid the example that you led 		You always said that the reward from the hard work we've done is the opportunity to do more 		Well you're right I've done well in navy then I get more harder work ahead of me 		And I think it could be even harder to see each other 		That's why I want to make this mother's day so truly special 		Above all mom I hope when you look at me you see the good man that you wanna your little boy to be 		I'm proud to call you my mother I'm proud to be your son 		You made me the man that I am today I love you with all my heart 	n  I got wet  I needed washing When I left for home  Wendy said it had been a happy day 
	 
	Feeling surprisingly better  I smiled at her and agreed  Three weeks later  I rushed to my beach in a state of near panic  I was in no mood to even greet Wendy  I thought I saw her mother on the porch and felt like demanding she keep her child at home 
	 
	"Look  if you don't mind " I said crossly when Wendy caught up with me  "I'd rather be alone today "
	 
	She seems unusually pale and out of breath 
	 
	"Why " she asked 
	 
	I turned to her and shouted  "Because my mother died " and thought  my God  why was I saying this to a little child 
	 
	"Oh " she said quietly  "then this is a bad day "
	 
	"Yes  and yesterday and the day before and-oh  go away "
	 
	"Did it hurt  "
	 
	"Did what hurt " I was exasperated17 with her  with myself 
	 
	"When she died " "Of course it hurt " I snapped  misunderstanding  wrapped up in myself  I strode off 
	 
	A month or so after that  when I next went to the beach  she wasn't there  Feeling guilty  ashamed and admitting to myself I missed her  I went up to the cottage after my walk and knocked at the door  A drawn18 looking young woman with honey-colored hair opened the door #p#    #e#
	 
	"Hello " I said  "I'm Ruth Peterson  I missed your little girl today and wondered where she was "
	 
	"Oh yes  Mrs  Peterson  please come in" "Wendy talked of you so much 
	 
	I'm afraid I allowed her to bother you  If she was a nuisance  please  accept my apologies "
	 
	"Not at all-she's a delightful19 child " I said  suddenly realizing that I meant it  "Where is she "
	 
	"Wendy died last week  Mrs  Peterson  She had leukemia  Maybe she didn't tell you " Struck dumb  I groped for a chair  My breath caught 
	 
	"She loved this beach; so when she asked to come  we couldn't say no 
	 
	She seemed so much better here and had a lot of what she called happy days  But the last few weeks  she declined rapidly   " her voice faltered20 
	 
	"She left something for you   if only I can find it  Could you wait a moment while I look "
	 
	I nodded stupidly  my mind racing21 for something  anything  to say to this lovely young woman  She handed me a smeared22 envelope  with MRS  P printed in bold  childish letters  Inside was a drawing in bright crayon hues-a yellow beach  a blue sea  and a brown bird  Underneath23 was carefully printed: A SANDPIPER TO BRING YOU JOY
	 
	Tears welled up in my eyes  and a heart that had almost forgotten to love opened wide  I took Wendy's mother in my arms  "I'm so sorry  I'm sorry  I'm so sorry " I muttered over and over  and we wept together 
	 
	The precious little picture is framed now and hangs in my study  Six words- one for each year of her life- that speak to me of harmony  courage  undemanding love  A gift from a child with sea-blue eyes and hair the color sand--- who taught me the gift of love
