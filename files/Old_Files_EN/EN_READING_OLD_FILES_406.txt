To respect my work my associates and myself To be honest and fair with them as I expect them to be honest and fair with me To be a man whose word carries weight To be a booster not a knocker; a pusher not a kicker; a motor not a clog1  To base my expectations of reward on a solid foundation of service rendered; to be willing to pay the price of success in honest effort To look upon my work as opportunity to be seized with joy and made the most of and not as painful drudgery2 to be reluctantly endured  To remember that success lies within myself; in my own brain my own ambition my own courage and determination To expect difficulties and force my way through them to turn hard experiences into capital for future struggles  To interest my heart and soul in my work and aspire3 to the highest efficiency in the achievement of results To be patiently receptive of just criticism and profit from its teaching To treat equals and superiors with respect and subordinates with kindly4 encouragement  To make a study of my business duties; to know my work from the ground up To mix brains with my efforts and use system and method in all I undertake To find time to do everything needful by never letting time find me or my subordinates doing nothing To hoard5 days as a miser6 does dollars to make every hour bring me dividends7 in specific results accomplished8 To steer9 clear of dissipation and guard my health of body and peace of mind as my most precious stock in trade  Finally to take a good grip on the joy of life; to play the game like a gentleman; to fight against nothing so hard as my own weakness and endeavor to grow in business capacity and as a man with the passage of every day of time us If it is going to be bad -- for the best of us are bad sometimes -- it begins to be bad from the outside not from the inside How many a pear which presents a blooming face to the world is rotten at the core How many an innocent-looking apple is harbouring a worm in the bud But the orange had no secret faults Its outside is a mirror of its inside and if you are quick you can tell the shopman so before he slips it into the bag
