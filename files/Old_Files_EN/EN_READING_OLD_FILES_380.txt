Life teaches us to live To live you have to exist To exist you should have a passport to this living world Thanks to your parents who brought you into this world  Parents have taken care of us and satisfied all our needs They helped whenever we were hungry afraid or iii They were always there by you whenever you needed them You almost assyned that they would always be there for you and never thought of how your life would be without them But as you grow up age also catches up with your parents and they need your help and support  Man is a child first after which he attains1 his youth After youth he again goes through the second phase of childhood also called as old age This is the phase where everyone needs a cornfort of a sense of belonging and being taken care of Wouldn't we all expect the same of security when we grow old Even our parents are expecting us to be their caretaker as they grow old But they never make that obvious to us They do their further duty by taking care of their grandchildren paying e-bills giving the clothes for laundry etc  Isn't it unfair on our part that we aren't giving them what they need the most It is our prime duty to take the very best care of them It's our pay back time Let's give the same sense of emotional security care and love to our parents in their old age "we can't put up a statue for every person who attended Harvard and died this place would look like a cemetery8 " "Oh no" the lady explained quickly "we don't want to erect a statue We thought we would give a building to Harvard " The president rolled his eyes He glanced at the gingham dress and homespun suit and then exclaimed "A building Do you have and earthly idea how much a building costs We have over seven and a half million dollars in the physical plant at Harvard  For a moment the lady was silent The president was pleased He could get rid of them now The lady turned to her husband and said quietly "Is that all it costs to start a university " Her husband nodded The president's face wilted9 in confusion and bewilderment Mr and Mrs Leland Stanford walked away traveling to Palo Alto California where they established the university that bears their name -- a memorial to a son that Harvard no longer cared about  You can easily judge the character of others by how they treat those who can do nothing for them or to them your composure through pacience  I choose the latter one  What have you chosen
