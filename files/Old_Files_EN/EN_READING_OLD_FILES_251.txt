	As a little boy there was nothing I liked better than Sunday aftemoons at my grandfather's farm in western Pennsylvania Surrounded by miles of winding1 stonewalls the house and barn provided endless hours of fun for a city kid like me I was used to parlors2 neat as a pin that seemed to whisper "Not to be touched "	 	I can still remember one afternoon when I was eight years old Since my first visit to the farm I'd wanted more than anything to be allowed to climb the stonewalls surrounding the property My parents would never approve The walls were old; some stones were missing others loose and crumbling3 Still my yearning4 to scramble5 across those walls grew so strong One spring afternoon I summoned all my courage and entered the living room where the adults had gathered after dinner 	 	"I uh I want to climb the stonewalls " I said hesitantly Everyone looked up "Can I climb the stonewalls " Instantly a chorus went up from the women in the room "Heavens no " they cried in dismay "You'll hurt yourself " I wasn't too disappointed; the response was just as I'd expected But before I could leave the room I was stopped by my grandfather' s booming voice "Hold on just a minute " I heard him say "Let the boy climb the stonewalls He has to learn to do things for himself "	 	"Scoot " he said to me with a wink6 "and come and see me when you get back " For the next two and a half hours I climbed those old walls and had the time of my life Later I met with my grandfather to tell him about my adventure I'll never forget what he said "Fred " he said grinning "you made this day a special day just by being yourself Always remember there's only one person in this whole world like you and I like you exactly as you are "	 	Many years have passed since then and today I host the television program Mister Rogers' Neighborhood seen by millions of children throughout America There have been changes over the years but one thing remains7 the same: my message to children at the end of almost every visit "There's only one person in this whole world like you and people can like you exactly as you are "tip like a question mark also indicates familiarity  friendliness10 and affection  8  Purring While a cat's purr isn't an always indication of love and happiness — cats also purr when they're scared or injured -- a happy cat may express affection by purring when he's curled up in your lap or rubbing against your leg ead  they view food as fuel  sleep as recovery  and pulse and pause with "work sprints7"
