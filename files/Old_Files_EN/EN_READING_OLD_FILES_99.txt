Well my solution is pretty simple Confirm the source of the information Yeah we all have those annoying moments Sometimes you dont go to gossip1 but gossip will come to you And this is particularly troubling in workplaces How to deal with that If you simply refuse to talk to others it will seem like that you have a low emotional2 intelligence which may also make your future work difficult Perhaps the best reply under this circumstance is to ask How did you know about this With this simple question you can find out whether the thing you are talking about is real information or not At the same time this also allows the other person to know that you are only interested in useful facts rather than gossip erested in useful facts rather than gossip 			It touched a part of me I had forgotten about	 	and it's an experience that will stay with me forever6 	 	I think about her sometimes	 	and hope she is doing well dge is an endless path 		 	Let's be each other's reminder2 my friend 		 	Keep learning 		 	Keep evolving 		 	Keep being humble3 and hungry 	reading literature  written work thought to have artistic3 merit  that has the best effect  He told the BBC that when reading something for pleasure  "the brain begins to work from different parts  from a different hemisphere and it gets excited  it gets pre-emotional  and you can see the brain coming to life "	 	Of course  it's easy in our smartphone generation to ditch a good book and fiddle4 with our phones instead  But opening up a paperback5 could be a simple way to help boost or maintain our mental health  It's thought they can help you set targets and find focus  And they may allow you to see that awkward situation you've been anxious about for weeks from someone else's perspective 	 	If you're not an avid6 reader it can be hard to know where to begin  If the Reading Agency book list doesn't appeal  you could to read book reviews  visit a library or bookshop or ask a friend  Once you've found the right text  you'll be hooked  And if you still love your technology  you could always use an e-reader ng your own end ” From then on  the fish put his own end behind him (where it belonged) and set out to explore the ocean
