The chess-board is the world: the pieces are the phenomena1 of the universe; the rules of the game are what we call the laws of nature The player on the other side is hidden from us We know that his play is always fair just and patient But also we know to our cost that he never overlooks a mistake or makes the smallest allowance for ignorance  mplete when we are able to go on a nice vacation  when we retire  The truth is  there's no better time to be happy than right now  Your life will always be filled with challenges3  It's best to admit this to yourself and decide to be happy  There is no way to happiness  Happiness is the way  So  treasure every moment that you have  Stop Waiting Stop waiting until you finish school  until you go back to school  until you lose ten pounds  until you gain ten pounds  until you have kids  until your kids leave the house  until you start work  until you retire  until you get married  until you get divorced4  until Friday night  until Sunday morning  until spring  until summer  until fall  until winter  until you die  until you are born again to decide that there is no better time than right now to be happy
