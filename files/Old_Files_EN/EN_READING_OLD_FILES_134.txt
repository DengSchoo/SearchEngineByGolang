If love hold hands forever; if miss protect him well You leave I will not see you You come no matter how difficult it is I will pick you up Walk then stray1 and memories are gone gradually; look then be tired and the starlight becomes dark; listen then wake up and start to complain; see you are gone suddenly I mess up A smile will defeat someones life a drop of tears will pay off one One flower blooms one flower fades these years from A to Z no inquiries2 At least there is one time that you forget yourself for someone Asking for no result no company no ownership And dont ask you to love me but let me meet you in my most beautiful life I never be known by whom so I wont be forgot It is not my purpose that l iving in other peoples memories Being superior is not noble Being noble is to be better me I dont participate in your past but I will participate your future from now on I wait because I know you will come someday now on 	 			I wait because I know you will come someday wise prevents us from admitting: how much it helps us to feel like desirable potent3 people	3	to be able to go out and flirt4 with someone else for a while without too many questions being asked 		In other words how profoundly loyal a whiff of surface disloyalty helps us to be 		Apart we appreciate 	4	Its a strange quirk5 of our minds but we only ever notice whats missing: the money we dont have; the weather we long for; the car we dont yet own 		Yet once anything is securely in our possession it disappears 		We only see  in the sense of notice  what isnt there 		The best way to lose ownership of something is to own it  and the surest way to forget your partner exists may be to ensure theyre beside you every night 	ta	When we were apart we can sample the gentle suffering of loneliness over the intense rage of suffocation6 	5	We never have to find out how much it can tarnish7 love to be with someone who has a different idea of a cutlery drawer or the correct way to suspend a towel 		Too often when were cohabiting we locate the difficulty of our relationships in a very erroneous place:				We think that it is the wrong person weve mistakenly got together with 						rather than keeping in mind that were with a pretty right person trying to do an exceptionally tricky8 thing: share a home 						It may in the end  strangely  just be a lot easier to love than to share a bathroom 						Our love stories are suffering from a mistaken cultural hierarchy9 						Just as the book is often wrongly thought more important than the essay so the live-in relationship is too readily assumed to be superior to the long-range version 						And yet without ever meaning to do so the long-distance relationship may simply despite all its evident challenges 						throw up some of the absolutely ideal conditions for true love to thrive 						We should be wise to imbibe10 a few of the lessons life normally only teaches us when theyre in Sydney and youre in Vancouver						and carefully import them into our lives even with the people unfortunate enough to be right next to us 			e already died and disappeared  They don’t have the chance to come and warn you
