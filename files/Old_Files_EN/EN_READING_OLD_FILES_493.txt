Lord are you trying to tell me something  For  Failure doesn't mean I'm a failure; It does mean I have not yet succeeded  Failure doesn't mean I've accomplished1 nothing; It does mean I've learned something  Failure doesn't mean I've been a fool; It does mean I'd enough faith to experiment  Failure doesn't mean I've disgraced; It does mean I've dared to try  Failure doesn't mean I don't have it; It does mean I've something to do in a different way  Failure doesn't mean I'm inferior; It does mean I ain't perfect  Failure doesn't mean I've wasted my life; It does mean that I've an excuse to start over  Failure doesn't mean that I should give up; It does mean that I should try harder  Failure doesn't mean that I'll never make it; It does mean that I need more practice  Failure doesn't mean that you've abandoned me; It does mean that you must have a better idea  rd a goal that you can achieve with your body  Don't try to change your basic shape or to go against your own unique physical capabilities2  Take an objective look at yourself  then work toward enhancing what you've got rather than trying to attain3 someone else's body ner of war " Somewhat dumbfounded  Charlie looked up at the guy and asked  "How in the world did you know all that " The man chuckled7 and said  "Because I packed your parachute " Charlie was speechless  The man grabbed Charlie's hand and pumped his arm and said  "I guess it worked " and walked off  Charlie laid awake that night  thinking about all the times he had walked through the long narrow room  below sea level on the aircraft carrier  with the tables where the men packed the parachutes  He wondered how many times he must have walked past this man without even saying "hi " "good morning" or "good job" or "I appreciate what you do " 　 "How many times did I pass the man whose job would eventually save my life   because I was a jet jockey  a top gun racing8 around the sky at twice the speed of sound  because I was a fighter pilot and he was just a sailor " he asked himself  Think about this for yourself  How many times in life do you pass the people who help you out the most  The people who come out of the far corners of your life just when you need them the most and pack your parachutes for you  The people who go the extra mile  the people who don't look for the kudos9 or the accolades10 or the achievement medal or even the bonus check -- the folks who are just out there packing parachutes
