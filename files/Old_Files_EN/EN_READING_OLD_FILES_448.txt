The best friend a man has in this world may turn against him and become his enemy His son or daughter whom he has reared with loving care may prove ungrateful Those who are nearest and dearest to us those whom we trust with our happiness and our good name may become traitors1 to their faith  The money that a man has he may lose It flies away from him perhaps when he needs it most A man's reputation may be sacrificed in a moment of ill-considered action The people who are prone2 to fall on their knees to do us honor when success is with us may be the first to throw the stone of malice3 when failure settles its cloud upon our heads The one absolute unselfish friend a man may have in this selfish world the one that never deserts him the one that never proves ungrateful or treacherous4 is his dog  A man's dog stands by him in prosperity and in poverty in health and in sickness He will sleep on the cold ground when the wintry winds blow and the snow drives fiercely if only he can be near his master's side He will kiss the hand that has no food to offer He will lick the sores and wounds that come in the encounter with the roughness of the world He guards the sleep of his pauper5 master as if he were a prince  When all other friends desert he remains6 When riches take wings and reputation falls to pieces he is as constant in his love as the sun in its journey through the heavens If fortune drives the master forth7 an outcast in the world friendless and homeless the faithful dog asks no higher privilege than that of accompanying him to guard him against danger to fight against his enemies And when the last scene of all comes and death takes its master in its embrace and the body is laid away in the cold ground no matter if all other friends pursue their way there by his graveside will the noble dog be found his head between his paws his eyes sad but open in alert watchfulness8 faithful and true even to death ps Everyone loves to talk to someone who truly listens to what they are saying
