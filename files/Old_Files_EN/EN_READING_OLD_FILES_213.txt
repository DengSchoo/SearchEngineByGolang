When I was a kid I thought I would grow up to be an actress I thought I would live in New York City in a highrise apartment building with my husband and family of oh five or six kids I thought Id live an urban impossibly sophisticated1 life Money would be no object Perhaps there would be a private plane I should mention here that these fantasies were firmly rooted in the 1980s Well I grew up and left the city for the country I married and had one child an only child just like I had been My husband and I work hard to make ends meet But my life my rich imperfect complicated contented2 life is the one Ive built for myself Its an honest life Its a life of integrity3 Its a life I love But to have it I had to lose my fantasy straight out of the pages of a magazine of what it was that I thought I wanted of who I thought I was I was underselling myself it turned out To love to really live is to become willing to lose people places things dreams even to lose versions of ourselves that no longer serve us And in place of what is lost something new emerges4 It may not be what we imagined But it is beautiful and it is ours beautiful and it is ours I bent3 down and so did he and we bashed heads At that moment the lift shuddered4 to a stop and the doors seemed to fling5 themselves wide open I was so embarrassed I marched out of the lift straight towards the queue at the counter I ordered without looking at the menu and took my tray to a table where there was only one empty seat I breathed a sigh of relief and began to eat But the salad stuck in my throat when I noticed that everyone else at the table had already finished lunch and they were getting up to go I glanced over at the counter He was paying and in a second his eyes would scan6 the room to find me I ducked my head Waited Any minute now he'd sit down with his tray 	 	Short Stories from Australasia My book appeared in front of my eyes His fingers were the longest I'd seen and his nails were manicured I hadn't thought he'd bother t up our hands and wait to be asked  They want us to keep asking other people for permission  They teach us to deliver on rather than change expectations  They teach us to redeploy ideas rather than originate them  They teach us to respect people in authority rather than imagine that  in rather inspiring ways  no one actually knows quite what's going on  They teach us everything other than the two skills that really determine the quality of adult life: knowing how to choose the right job for us and knowing how to form satisfactory relationships  They'll instruct us in Latin and how to measure the circumference10 of a circle long before they teach us these core subjects: work and love

	That said  it isn't that all we need to do to succeed at life is flunk3 school  A good life requires us to do two very tricky11 things: be a very good boy or girl for 20 years  and simultaneously12  never really believe blindly in the long-term validity or seriousness of what we're being asked to study  We need to be outwardly entirely obedient while inwardly intelligently and unashamedly rebellious13
