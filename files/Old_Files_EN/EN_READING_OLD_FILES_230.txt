And then I helped and we chased all over the place after them papers When we sat down to get our breath back he told me he was a student He was ever so clever Cant remember what the devil it was he was studyin Somethin Id never heard of then or since Why didnt you marry him Marry him Good Lord Leanna I wasnt ready to marry and he wasnt the type Id have wanted to marry by a long shot What else did he look like Mom Lord stop the questions child Get some sleep She saw my disappointment however and said she would write it all down for me Put it in an envelope to open when she was dead and gone I was happy with that On a wet slick highway driving to France for a weekend she was involved in an accident and died instantly I was twentythree then and on my own feet but as I sorted through and packed up the belongings1 in her flat I felt like a child again I looked for the envelope but didnt find one For a long time after my mothers death and not knowing who my father was made me feel as though I was drifting on a sea without horizons One lunchtime I just decided2 to brave it and ask Malcolm who I reminded him of Met her while I was a student he said Was she studying too Oh heavens no That was what attracted me to her She was  so different What were you like I asked Like Much as I am now Nose in books bit of a loner Not very interesting Not for a live wire like she was Go on I said She fell pregnant I was very happy until she told me she didnt want my help Thought shed change her mind though as the pregnancy3 advanced but when I attempted to see her she told me to leave her be I was very hurt but accepted her refusal to involve me A few months later I took a job Id been offered in New York Salary was dreadful but I thought it would be for the best Was it I asked No When I returned theyd moved Left no forwarding address t it would be for the best "	 	"Was it " I asked 	 	"No When I returned they'd moved Left no forwarding address ""ark I was catching3 a suntan and these papers started blowin' in my face I was a bit cheesed off at them blowin' all over me and then this man comes runnin' He grabbed4 and grabbed but couldn't catch them all So he jus' stood still a helpless look on his face It was so funny I started laughin' "ur life (although stopping and smelling the roses is a grand thing to do)  It's about floral scents8 and the effect they have on mood  Much research has been conducted on how floral scents can influence behaviors  In one set of experiments  researchers found that a floral-scented room led to increased happiness and friendliness9  One researcher noted10 that the floral smell is an emotion manipulator and improves the mood  "The floral odors can make you happy; floral odors promote social interaction  social approach kinds of behaviors " said Jeannette Haviland-Jones  of Rutgers University 
	 
	6  They get dirty
	 
	Commence making mud pies  Medical researchers in the U K  found evidence that “friendly” bacteria found in soil may activate11 the immune system  boost the brain compound serotonin and help ward12 off depression 
	 
	7  They exercise
	 
	We know you didn't want to hear that  but fret13 not  The good news is that middle-aged14 women don't have to run marathons or go all-out for the emotional benefits of physical activity to kick in  And in fact  a study found that moderate intensity15 exercise — as opposed to intense exercise — caused more women to report later that they were in a better mood and to have greater feelings of energy  psychological well-being and "self-efficacy "
	 
	8  They don't try to be … happy 
	 
	Oops  Now that we've told you the secrets for happiness  we're here to dash your dreams  A prominent study shows that making happiness a personal goal will actually stand in the way of your achieving it  The researchers found that women who valued happiness more reported being less happy and more depressed16 than women who didn't place much importance on the goal 
	 
	"Wanting to be happy can make you less happy " said study researcher Iris17 Mauss  "If you explicitly18 and purposely focus on happiness  that appears to have a self-defeating quality "
	 
	So if you really want to be happy  try forgetting about it ich with experiences and every child fresh; every dog is animated19 and every pigeon keen

	Every morning I do the same thing  although I am now different from before  always dreaming of unusual encounters and always wishing to inspire fervent20 passions  yet always being fooled by peevish21 reality and awakened22 from fanatical visions by such unusual weather  like today  I am now no longer lonely  Right

	This loneliness is like a padded cotton quilt  spread out high in the sky  It can be depressing  descending23  entwining  or uplifting  depending on the change in the number of people who share my room  Beautiful  isn't it  Yes  but a little cruel  I know
