I Have Run Headon into AutumnBecause early morning is the most pleasant time of the day in this long hot summer I have developed a habit of getting up or going to bed at daybreak which is around four thirty for sure That is the pattern of my life But last night I went to bed earlier at about eleven oclock When I wake up it is still dark outside I am about to go back to sleep when I suddenly become aware of the unusualness in the buzz of mosquitoes and the flow of the air They dont seem to be happening during the thick darkness of midnight Looking at my watch I find it already five oclock as I have expected After rolling out of bed and rushing through my morning routine I walk out of my room which is as hot and smoky as a kitchen No sooner have I stepped out of the halfway1 than I run headon into autumn almost to be knocked back First comes the wind slowly like a huge fluttering skirt caressing2 me from head to toe Like toothpaste being squeezed I feel an immediate3 thorough relief in my heart I am not as energetic in the summer as I am in the winter mainly due to the lucidness of my mind Now an earlier autumn has come to resolve my problem Why not go with it The sky that has borne me down throughout the whole summer has suddenly lifted Looking up I see numerous smallsized clouds as white assterling silver neatly4 lined up in the limpidly5 blue sky The more I gaze at them the more they look naughty and resemble my innate6 inspirations How I wish I could bring them down and take a few bites at them I now remember a song I wrote quite a while ago <I See a Face in the Sky> but now my mood is quite different from what it was then and I am also much older am I So I stand there looking at those clouds I want to continue looking at them until they slowly disappear and are firmly implanted in my mind There are more and more passersby Some of them look up into the sky like me those are romantic types and I bless them; some of them give me a weird7 look and then hurry away those are people whom I bless too because they have a purpose to be busy This is what life should be like: you have to do something or feel something Each of these two choices is respectable and cannot be taken lightly This is just like me at the moment: I now stand my ground Like an old antelope8 I have to be coolheaded in holding myself in my own territory next to the earthen wares9 and the wire fences Everything will be alright by six oclock when by the park gate there will be vendors10 selling delicious and succulent minced11 pork dumplings to go with jellied tofu soup thickly dressed with fresh green parsley over brightly red chili12 oil and loosely dotted with chopped smoked turnips13 And there will also be deepfried dough14 sticks as hottempered as felines15 soybean milk as demure16 as a lovely girlfriend and crispycrusted tenderhearted greenonionflavored pancakes as intimate as a bosom17 friend Of all the houses tightly lined up here every window has behind it a story that I have also experienced or that I am interested in hearing; everysleepwalking man cannot help fidgeting like me and every woman in pajamas18 has been loved or is now in love; every old man is rich with experiences and every child fresh; every dog is animated19 and every pigeon keen Every morning I do the same thing although I am now different from before always dreaming of unusual encounters and always wishing to inspire fervent20 passions yet always being fooled by peevish21 reality and awakened22 from fanatical visions by such unusual weather like today I am now no longer lonely Right This loneliness is like a padded cotton quilt spread out high in the sky It can be depressing descending23 entwining or uplifting depending on the change in the number of people who share my room Beautiful isnt it Yes but a little cruel I know Wow my Beijing the one that just had a traffic control yesterday the one that has had the highest temperature in the country this summer the one that has revitalized my nerves with a fresh autumn and the one that has thoroughly24 disordered my life completely unfolded my story and carefullyturned me into a new paper to write the story on  completely unfolded my story and carefullyturned me into a new paper to write the story on 	n
