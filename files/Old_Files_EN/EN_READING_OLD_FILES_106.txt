A few years ago when I was going through the deepest point in my depressionmy living situation was abhorrent1 I had no car no license2and barely3 enough money to get by All of this was because of the choices I madebut I couldnt seem to find my way out I was riding the bus home one day from workwhen an older woman sat across from meand struck4 up a conversation She asked meif I took the bus oftenand I replied with a yes She told mehow she had just lost her joband that she wouldnt be needing her bus pass anymoreand offered it to me This woman had zero knowledge of my current5 situationand on one of her worst days she still found a way to be kind to someone else It touched a part of me I had forgotten aboutand its an experience that will stay with me forever6 I think about her sometimesand hope she is doing well rience that will stay with me forever6 	Â 	I think about her sometimes	Â 	and hope she is doing well had quit her job and was on her way to Jamaica with Belizaire to create The Runaway4 a bed-and-breakfast that has grown into a lifestyle travel brand 	Â 	"We ran away from the cold and the typical 9-5 to follow our dreams and create this new life "says Martin 	Â 	And this isnt your average bed-and-breakfast The Runaway Jamaica is the first successfully funded B&B on Kickstarter Backers donated almost $47 000 to help bring the property to life se it's easy in our smartphone generation to ditch a good book and fiddle4 with our phones instead But opening up a paperback5 could be a simple way to help boost or maintain our mental health It's thought they can help you set targets and find focus And they may allow you to see that awkward situation you've been anxious about for weeks from someone else's perspective 	Â 	If you're not an avid6 reader it can be hard to know where to begin If the Reading Agency book list doesn't appeal you could to read book reviews visit a library or bookshop or ask a friend Once you've found the right text you'll be hooked And if you still love your technology you could always use an e-reader t that fear is never as bad as we believe it to be 	Â 	5 It's better than over analyzing4 what you want to do 	Â 	You know what happens when you start over analyzing something  You stress yourself out  You wear yourself out  you worry  you over think  you make stuff up in your head  and you over exaggerate  What an imagination our brains have  But seriously speaking  there's only so much analyzing you can do  At some point you're going to have to kick your ass5 into gear  At some point you'll have to put the key in the ignition  start the engine  and push the pedal  You can't do that with your mind 	Â 	4 Procrastinating6 won't get you anywhere 	Â 	Getting started is easy  simple  and doable  Yet procrastinating is also easy to do  Ironic7 isn't it  But the truth is  delaying what you've been dying to do isn't going to benefit you  At best  it'll hinder you in more ways than one  Remember what I said earlier about what we do everyday is a habit  Well If you procrastinate8 enough  that habit will creep into other parts of your life as well  If you procrastinate with simple things  you'll procrastinate with harder things  One leads to another  Start small If you must  but at the least you need to get started 	Â 	3 The last thing you want to do is regret not starting 	Â 	Regretting what you've done is one thing  but regretting what you've never done is another  Lets be honest  regretting what you haven't done is so much worse  Especially when it's something you're adamant9 to do  You don't want to be that person who regrets it 30 years from now  do you 	Â 	2 You can adjust your actions along the way 	Â 	Ready  aim  fire  You've heard of the saying  right  Well what happens if you spend all your time aiming  and not firing  You'll never hit anything  That's basically what you're doing by thinking too much and not getting started  Ready  fire  aim should be your approach  You might not get it right on the first shot  but you can adjust your aim as you go along 	Â 	It's better to make a mistake than do nothing at all 	Â 	This ties in with the last point I just made  I don't like to make mistakes  you don't like to mistakes  nobody likes to make mistakes  But nobody's perfect so it's impossible not to make a mistake  As great as computers and smartphones are  even they can make mistakes  You can't get away from it  And that's OK  Just be sure to get started on whatever you've been delaying for so long  And when you do make a mistake  learn from it and get it right the next time  Then you'll be way ahead  I can guarantee you that €“ you see yourself as a â€œreaderâ€ and so do others  which further motivates and compounds the habit of reading  Next  try out an audiobook  Give yourself a month to listen to one book  youâ€™ll realize that you fly through the book much quicker than this  Itâ€™s a fun and leisurely18 way of reading more books  And who doesnâ€™t like being read to by someone else
