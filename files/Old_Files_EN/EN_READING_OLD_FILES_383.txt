People are often unreasonable1 illogical and self-centered; Forgive then anyway  If you are kind people may accuse you of selfish ulterior motives2; Be kind anyway  If you are successful you will win some false friends and some true enemies; Succeed anyway  If you are honest and frank people may cheat you; Be honest and frank anyway  What you spend years building someone could destroy overnight; Build anyway  If you find serenity3 and happiness they may be jealous; Be happy anyway  The good you do today people will often forget tomorrow; Do good anyway  Give the world the best you have and it may never be enough; Give the world the best you've got anyway  You see in the final analysis it is between you and God: It was never between you and them anyway  around people who are negative and limiting find other people to hang out with  Get around positive successful people  Beliefs also come from past experiences  That is why it is so important to experience success on a regular basis  Set small achievable goals and then try your best to reach them  "I will finish this project by early afternoon " "I will make six calls on the phone in the next hour " "I will exercise for 20 minutes tonight " When you start to experience success then you start to believe in success and that leads to more and bigger successes  Beliefs come from knowledge  The more you learn the more things you will know to be possible  Always take advantage of opportunities to learn something new It will bring new possibilities into your beliefs and your life  Most importantly you can develop new beliefs by setting and visualizing3 goals for your life  Define your goals clearly and with precision  Then in your mind see yourself achieving them in all of their sensory4 details  Mentally live the experience see the sights hear the sounds smell the aroma5 feel the feelings Your nurtured6 beliefs will lead you to their reality nd hurt opens the wound to clean it and then gradually teaches it to heal itself Wounds need to be taught to heal themselves  The psyche15 and the spirit do not share the instinct of damaged body Healing is automatically triggered nor is danger usually avoided Since we put ourselves in the way of hurt it seems logical to put ourselves in the way of healing Art has more work to do than ever before but it can do that work In a self-destructive society like our own it is unsurprising that art as a healing force is despised  For myself when I returned to my to my borrowed room night after night and there were my books I felt relief and exuberance16 not hardship and exhaustion17 I intended to avoid the fate of Jude the Obscure although a reading of that book was a useful warning What I wanted did not belong to me by right and whilst it could not be refused tome in quite same way we still have subtle punishments for anyone who insists on what they are and what they want Walled inside the little space marked out for by family and class it was the limitless world of imagination that it possible for me to scale the sheer face of other people's assumptions Inside books there is perfect space and it is that space which allows the reader to escape from the problems of gravity
