This is allegedly actual text from an American home economics text book circa 1950  Have dinner ready Plan ahead even the night before to have a delicious meal on time This is a way of letting him know you've been thinking about him and concerned about his needs Most men are hungry when they come home and the prospect1 of a good meal is part of the warm welcome needed  Prepare yourself Take fifteen minutes to rest so that you will be refreshed when he arrives Touch up your makeup2 put a ribbon in your hair and be fresh looking He has just been with a lot of work-weary people Be a little gay and a little more interesting His boring day may need a lift  Clear away the clutter3 Make one last trip through the main part of the house just before your husband arrives gather up school books toys paper etc Run a dust cloth over the tables Your husband will feel he has reached a haven4 of rest and order; and it will give you a lift too  Prepare the children Take a few minutes to wash the children's hands and faces (if they're small) comb their hair and if necessary change their clothes They are little treasures and he would like to see them playing the part  Minimize all noise At the time of his arrival eliminate all noise of the washer dryer5 dishwasher or vacuum Try to encourage the children to be quiet Be happy to see him Greet him with a warm smile and be glad to see him  Some Don'ts: Don't greet him with problems and complaints Don't complain if he is late for dinner Count this as minor6 compared to what he might have gone through that day Make him comfortable Have him lean back in a comfortable chair or suggest that he lie down in the bedroom Have a cool drink ready for him Arrange his pillow and offer to take off his shoes Speak in a low soft soothing7 and pleasant voice Allow him to relax and unwind  Listen to him You may have a dozen things to tell him but the moment of his arrival is not the time Let him talk first  Make the evening his Never complain if he does not take you out to dinner or other pleasant entertainment Instead try to understand his world of strain and pressure his need to unwind and relax  The goal Try to make your home a place of peace and order where your husband can relax in body and spirit scared or injured -- a happy cat may express affection by purring when he's curled up in your lap or rubbing against your leg ase from the seasonal20 depression caused by the reduced hours of sunlight during the dark months of winter  But for most of us  it is a release from the mundane21 things that after three months have added up to the point where we are all just ready for a change  You know: things like having to wear layers of heavy clothing  white-knuckle drives to work on icy roads  and leaving home mornings in the dark only to drive back home again in darkness later the same afternoon  The crocus and daffodils will soon start peeking22 their heads above last year's pine bark nuggets and what's left of the winter snow still piled in the beds under the white pines out by the road  They are yet another prelude to the appearance of more flowers and birds: the warblers and the tanagers that will shortly appear in the trees around my home  I can't wait to inhale23 the aromas24 of things like the warming earth  new mown grass  and fresh piles of damp cedar mulch  And I am looking forward to that first morning when I can sit outside on my deck with a cup of coffee and feel comfortable without having to don a fleece or a heavy woolen25 shirt  Whatever your passion in life  take time like the busy King Solomon to pause from it for a moment over the next few weeks and just sit and watch and enjoy the spectacle of spring unfold before your eyes  And give thanks classroom  I know you're busy with all the things that a teacher does at the beginning of the school year  so I'll make this letter short  But I did want you to know about the night before that first day  We got her lunch packed in the Care Bear lunch box  We got the backpack ready with the school supplies  We laid out her special dress and shoes  read a story  and then I shut off the lights  I gave her a kiss and started to walk out of the room  She called me back in and asked me if I knew that God wrote letters to people and put them in their minds  I told her I never had heard that  but I asked if she had received a letter  She had  She said the letter told her that her first day of school was going to be one of the best days of her life  I wiped away a tear as I thought: Please let it be so  Later that night I discovered a note Beth left for me  It read  'I'm so lucky to have you for a dad ' Well  Beth's first-grade teacher  I think you're so lucky to have her as a student  We're all counting on you  Every one of us who left our children and our dreams with you that day  As you take our youngsters13 by the hand  stand a little taller and walk a little prouder  Being a teacher carries with it an awesome14 responsibility #p#    #e#
