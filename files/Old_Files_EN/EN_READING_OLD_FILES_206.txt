Charm is the ultimate weapon the supreme1 seduction against which there are few defenses If youve got it you need neither money looks nor pedigree Its a gift given only to give away and the more used the more there is It is also a climate of behavior set for perpetual summer and thermostatically2 controlled by taste and tact3 True charm is an aura an invisible musk4 in the air; if you see it working the spell is broken Charm is dynamic and cannot be turned on and off at will As to its ingredients there is no fixed5 formula A whole range of mysteries goes into the caldron but the magic it offers must be absoluteone cannot be almost or partly charmed In a woman charm is probably more exacting6 than in a man requiring a wider array of subtleties7 It is a light in the face an air of exclusive welcome an almost impossibly sustained note of satisfaction in ones company and regret without fuss at parting A woman with charm finds no man dull; indeed in her presence he becomes not just a different person but the person he most wants to be Such a woman gives life to his deepheld fantasies by adding the necessary conviction to his long suspicion that he is king Of those women who have most successfully charmed me I remember chiefly their voices and eyes Their voices were intimate and enveloping8 The listening eyes supreme charm in a woman betrayed no concern with any other world than this warmly wrapping one round with total attention and turning ones lightest words to gold Theirs was a charm that must have continued to exist like the flower in the desert even when there was nobody there to see it A womans charm spreads round her that particular glow of wellbeing9 for which any man will want to seek her out and by making full use of her nature celebrates the fact of his maleness and so gives him an extra shot of life Her charm lies also in that air of timeless maternalism10 that calm and pacifying11 presence which can dispel12 a mans moments of frustration13 and anger and restore his failures of will Charm in a man I suppose is his ability to capture the complicity of a woman by a singleminded acknowledgment of her uniqueness Here again it is a question of being totally absorbed of really forgetting that anyone else exists for nothing more fatally betrays than the suggestion of a wandering eye Silent devotion is fine but seldom sufficient; it is what a man says that counts the bold declarations the flights of fancy the uncovering of secret virtues14 A man is charmed through his eyes a woman by what she hears so no man need to be too anxious about his age: As wizened15 Voltaire once said: Give me a few minutes to talk away my face and I can seduce16 the Queen of France But charm isnt exclusively sexual; it comes in a variety of cooler flavors Most children have ittill they are told they have itand so do old people with nothing to lose; animals too of course With children and smaller animals it is often in the shape of the head and in the chaste17 unaccusing stare; with young girls and ponies18 a certain stumbling awkwardness a leggy inability to control their bodies But all these are passive and appeal by capturing ones protective instincts You know who has charm But can you acquire it Properly you cant because its an originality19 of touch you have to be born with Or its something that grows naturally out of another quality like the simple desire to make people happy Certainly charm is not a question of learning palpable tricks like wrinkling your nose or having a laugh in your voice On the other hand there is an antenna20 a builtin awareness21 of others which most people have and which care can nourish But in a study of charm what else does one look for Apart from the ability to listenrarest of all human virtuesapart from warmth sensitivity and the power to please there is a generosity22 which makes no demands Charm spends itself willingly on young and old alike on the poor the ugly the dim the boring on the last fat man in the corner It reveals itself also in a sense of ease in casual but perfect manners and often in a physical grace which springs less from an accident of youth than from a confident serenity23 of mind Any person with this is more than just a popular fellow; he is also a social healer Charm in the end is a most potent24 act of behavior the laying down of a carpet by one person for another to give his existence a moment of honor It is close to love in that it moves without force bearing gifts like the growth of daylight It snares25 completely but is never punitive26 It disarms27 by being itself disarmed28 strikes without wounds wins wars without casualtiesthough not of course without victims peIn the armory29 of man charm is the enchanted30 dart31 light and subtle as a hummingbird32 But it is deceptive33 in one thinglike a sense of humor if you think youve got it you probably havent one thing--like a sense of humor if you think you've got it you probably haven't
