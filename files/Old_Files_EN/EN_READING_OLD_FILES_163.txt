Once upon a time a daughter complained to her father that her life was miserable1 and that she didnt know how she was going to make it She was tired of fighting and struggling all the time It seemed just as one problem was solved another one soon followed Her father a chef took her to the kitchen He filled three pots with water and placed each on a high fire Once the three pots began to boil he placed potatoes in one pot eggs in the second pot and ground coffee beans in the third pot He then let them sit and boil without saying a word to his daughter The daughter moaned2 and impatiently waited wondering what he was doing After twenty minutes he turned off the burners He took the potatoes out of the pot and placed them in a bowl He pulled the eggs out and placed them in a bowl He then ladled the coffee out and placed it in a cup Turning to her he asked Daughter what do you see Potatoes eggs and coffee she hastily3 replied Look closer he said and touch the potatoes She did and noted4 that they were soft He then asked her to take an egg and break it After pulling off the shell she observed the hardboiled egg Finally he asked her to sip5 the coffee Its rich aroma6 brought a smile to her face He then explained that the potatoes the eggs and coffee beans had each faced the same adversity the boiling water However each one reacted differently The potato went in strong hard and unrelenting but in boiling water it became soft and weak The egg was fragile7 with the thin outer shell protecting its liquid interior8 until it was put in the boiling water Then the inside of the egg became hard However the ground coffee beans were unique After they were exposed to the boiling water they changed the water and created something new Which are you he asked his daughter When adversity knocks on your door how do you respond Are you a potato an egg or a coffee bean Moral: In life things happen around us things happen to us but the only thing that truly matters is what happens within us Which one are you truly matters is what happens within us 	 	Which one are you 	  	 tmas " We thought that it was a very clever gift and the thoughtfulness of our "elf" touched our hearts We put the cassette in our player and song by song the spirit of Christmas began to warm our hearts 	 	That was the beginning of a series of gifts from the clever giver one for each day until Christmas Each gift followed the theme of "The Twelve Days of Christmas" in a creative way The kids especially liked "seven swans a-swimming " which was a basket of swan-shaped soaps plus passes to the local swimming pool giving the kids something to look forward to when the warm days of spring arrived "Eight maids a-milking" included eight bottles of chocolate milk eggnog and regular milk in glass bottles with paper faces handmade aprons6 and caps Every day was something very special The "five golden rings" came one morning just in time for breakfast - five glazed7 doughnuts just waiting to be eaten 	 	We would get calls from our family neighbors and friends who would want to know what we had received that day Together we would chuckle8 at the ingenuity9 and marvel10 at the thoughtfulness as we enjoyed each surprise We were so caught up in the excitement and curiosity of what would possibly come next that our grief didn't have much of a chance to rob us of the spirit of Christmas What our elf did was absolutely miraculous11 	 	Each year since then as we decorate our Christmas tree we place on it the decorations we received that Christmas while we play the song "The Twelve Days of Christmas " We give thanks for our elf who was we finally realized our very own Christmas angel We never did find out who it was although we have our suspicions We actually prefer to keep it that way It remains12 a wondrous13 and magical experience - as mysterious and blessed as the very first Christmas erience - as mysterious and blessed as the very first Christmas  first Christmas
