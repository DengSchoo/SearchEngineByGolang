Ive lived in my condo for 15 years nowlong enough that I dont even see it anymore I started dreaming about moving into a house where I was bound to be happier 15I fixated on little yellow houses somewhere in the suburbs of Chicago and watched for them from the train on my commute Oh looktheres one Id say as it slid by Then one day sitting in the sun on my patio I looked up and realized the outside of my condo was done in yellow siding I already had a yellow house And I was home I was home 		ave to open your heart to see it 		 	For me it is there every time I watch the dawn break upon a new day It is there every time a brisk winter breeze blows across my face It is there in the first flower of Spring It is there in the green grass of Summer It is there in the last leaf of Fall It is there every time my handicapped sons give me a hug It is there every time my daughter laughs at one of my dumb jokes It is there in the adoring eyes of my old beagle and my new puppy It is there in the purring cat that naps on my chest It is there in the smile of the clerk behind the counter It is there in the old man who opens a door for me It is there when I read a letter from a friend It is there every time I pray It is there in everything I write and every act of kindness I do 		 	The Bible tells us that God is Love  And since God is without beginning or end then so is love It fills all of His creation It fills us as well every time we open our hearts and souls to it Dont shut out love then Dont live your life in pain Open your heart instead Share your love instead You will find that the more love you give away the more love you will have You will find that the more love you share the more Gods love will surround you You will find that when you live your life in love you will find love everywhere 	 of our hard work Fall has come It is a golden time--- rich and fulfilling We experience a more mature love that accepts and understands our partners imperfections as well as our own It is a time of thanksgiving and sharing Having worked hard during the summer we can relax and enjoy the love we have created 	 	The winter of love	 	Then weather changes again and winter comes During the cold barren months of winter all of our nature pulls back within itself It is a time of rest reflection and renewal6 	 	It is a time and relationships we experience only unresolved pain or our shadow self It is when our lid comes off and our painful feeling emerge It is a time of solitary7 growth when who need to look more to ourselves than to our partners for love and fulfillment It is a time of healing This is the time when men hibernate8 in their caves and women sink to the bottom of their wells 	 	After loving and healing ourselves through the dark winter of love then spring inevitably9 returns Once again we are blessed with the feeling of hope love and an abundance of possibilities Based on our inner healing and soul searching of our winter journey we are then able to open our hearts and feel springtime of love 	 		 		 		 		 		 		 	 	 		 		 		 		 	t ever -- that's just what parents do  But after seeing Kendall perform  I know she's one of the best  even though she didn't make it into the Top 24 
	 
	Kendall is eighteen now  living every day to its fullest  She's recorded a CD with some of John Mellencamp's band members  She's also on CMT's Music City Madness for an original song and video  and is having some good success  I'm absolutely sure she's going to make it big some day  Kendall just puts it all in God's hands 
	 
	When she was a little girl trying hard to be strong  she looked up at me  her big eyes brimming with tears  and asked me why she had to have Tourette's Syndrome  My heart ached to make the world right for my child  But I looked right back at her and told her the truth as I see it 
	 
	"Kendall  God gave you a pure heart  an angelic voice  a strong mind  and a beautiful presence  With all of that  he had to make it fair for everyone else "     ，             ，            。
	 
	What a surprise for the two merchants when they uncovered an earthen pot full of gold coins  Before breaking it  Hassan noted12 an inscription13 near the handle: "The first of seven "
	          ：              ！       ，                 ：“   ，   。”
	 
	The first of seven  That means there should be six more pots buried Jehdi understood  starting to regret the deal he had concluded too quickly 
	“       ，            。”     ，                  。
	 
	This time both of them dug with energy and  sure enough  they found the six pots  one after another  each one filled to the brim with gold coins 
	   ，        ，  ，      ，           ，         。
	 
	Hassan built a huge inn in the city and named it The Bulgy14 Pot  He lived as a rich and satisfied man until his death 
	            ，       “  ”。         ，    。
	 
	When Hassan was alive  Jehdi often came to visit him and greeted his friend with the words  "Well  Hassan  how are you  I have come to see what has happened to my dream " And then the two comrades patted each other on the back laughing  But every time Jehdi returned home sadder  for he knew that he could never buy back his dream
