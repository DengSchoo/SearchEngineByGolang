Theres a moment in the morning where Im a blank slatenot a thought in my head And I dont want to fill it with another violent headline You see we become obsessed with reading every little detail about the senseless acts of violence Theres so much bad; theres so much injustice It can just feel insurmountable Thats no way to live Its time for a change Every day since third grade before I ran off to the bus my mom would tell me to choose joy And thats exactly what we need to bring back the color to this bleachedout landscape What if we all choose joy Paint the world with color It cant undo the senseless acts of violence but it will make a difference Choosing joy doesnt mean we ignore the problem It means we attack it with a positive approach I can look up from my daily routine and see the joy around me I can look for the positive and bring back the color to my life We can bring back the color and paint the world Now this isnt a bandaid that can be applied to fix everything overnight but it can change your world that you live in and change the world of the people around you OKPainting the world isnt a solo mission It takes a team but you as an individual on this wonderful planet can start at home and let the color spill from one person to the next to the next until we create this incredible everchanging masterpiece And I think that its so cool that every day and everyone can contribute something new You can add color back to this landscape You can choose joy You can let it spread by sharing a kind word or making meaningful actions And I can hope that itll spread to everyone it touches that those who experience an act of joy will pass it on And its hard But when you have a positive impact on others you can hope they return the favor when you need it most So I wanna challenge you to smile and nod and acknowledge the people you pass on the street to give your waiter a slightly above average tip Next time you say to yourself or your friends Hey I like that persons sweater tell them Dont keep the positivity to yourself Share it Surround yourself with likeminded people Open the door for strangers High five to the guy next you Buy him a drink The next time someone cusses you out on the street dont even look back Tell the people in your life you love them Ask your friends how theyre doing and listen to their answers If you see someone struggling help them If you see someone having a great day rejoice with them because they are choosing joy All these different shades of red blue and green make life more exciting They say that hate breeds hate but why cant love ignite love joy increase joy I say lets make kindness go viral Choose joy and let the color spread as we paint ourselves a new world color spread as we paint ourselves a new world 	ng and healing ourselves through the dark winter of love  then spring inevitably9 returns  Once again  we are blessed with the feeling of hope  love and an abundance of possibilities  Based on our inner healing and soul searching of our winter journey  we are then able to open our hearts  and feel springtime of love 	 	 	                                                                                	 	 	                                                                                                          	 	 	                                                                	 	                                                                                                                                                                                                                     	 	 	                                                                                                   	 	 	                                                                                                                                        	 	                                                                              l doll  and the picture of the little boy in the store  I left there in tears  thier life changed forever  The love that little boy had for his little sisiter and his mother was overwhel  And in a split8 second a drunk driver had ripped9 the life of that little boy to pieces
