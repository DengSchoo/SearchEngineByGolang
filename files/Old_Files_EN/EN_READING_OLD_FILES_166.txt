Six people were travelling1 in a compartment2 on a train Five of them were quiet and well behaved3 but the sixth4 was5 a rude7 young man who was causing8 a lot of trouble9 to the other passengers11 At last this young man got12 out at a station with his two heavy bags None13 of the other passengers helped him but one of them waited until14 the rude young man was very far away and then opened the window and shouted to him You left something behind in the compartment Then he closed15 the window again The young man turned around and hurried back with his two bags He was very tired when he arrived but he shouted through the window What did16 I leave behind As6 the train began to move again the passenger10 who had17 called him back opened the window and said18 A very bad impression19 ry bad impression19 " friends but that was okay because they were -- and continue to be -- real the kind who stick by her no matter what Through all this Kendall continued to sing and entertain Remarkably7 her tics disappeared when she sang 	 	We took our daughter from doctor to doctor but all they did was give her medication that just made it worse so we decided8 to go the natural route Through chiropractic therapy changes in her diet and other natural treatments the tics gradually lessened9 	 	In 2005 when Kendall was sixteen we thought she was pretty much out of the woods -- or at least heading in that direction However as if Tourette's Syndrome wasn't enough for a beautiful young girl to deal with a freak accident happened 	 	At a birthday party Kendall hopped10 on a friend for a piggyback ride He bent11 lower than she expected and she jumped higher than he expected Kendall flew over his back and landed on the cement floor -- on her neck An ambulance rushed her to the hospital where she spent the next week paralyzed from the neck down Ironically her biggest concern wasn't whether she would walk again but whether she would be able to audition12 for American Idol13 	 	Doctors said Kendall had central cord syndrome The pain was excruciating and required morphine to control it Sometimes it was so unbearable14 she had to bite down on a toothbrush to take her mind off it As the days dragged on feeling returned to her left side but she was still paralyzed on the right We didn't know for sure how much of her movement would ever come back 	 	I believe Kendall wanted the American Idol audition so much that she willed herself to move again One of her friends brought a microphone to the hospital and put it on her bed Every day Kendall tried hard to pick it up with her right hand It was more important for her to pick up that mic than a spoon or fork 	 	Sometimes we all cried because of the pain we witnessed But on the day Kendall walked into the stadium to audition for American Idol -- a mere15 three months after her accident -- we cried tears of joy And our tears turned into shouts when she was given a golden ticket to Hollywood 	 	As a parent you always think your child is the best ever -- that's just what parents do But after seeing Kendall perform I know she's one of the best even though she didn't make it into the Top 24 	 	Kendall is eighteen now living every day to its fullest She's recorded a CD with some of John Mellencamp's band members She's also on CMT's Music City Madness for an original song and video and is having some good success I'm absolutely sure she's going to make it big some day Kendall just puts it all in God's hands 	 	When she was a little girl trying hard to be strong she looked up at me her big eyes brimming with tears and asked me why she had to have Tourette's Syndrome My heart ached to make the world right for my child But I looked right back at her and told her the truth as I see it 	 	"Kendall God gave you a pure heart an angelic voice a strong mind and a beautiful presence With all of that he had to make it fair for everyone else "d pop culture  and it's like  I don't care  That's never going to be relevant in the future
