Sometimes people come into your life and you know right away that they were meant to be there to serve some sort of purpose teach you a lesson or to help you figure out who you are or who you want to become  You never know who these people may be - a roommate a neighbor a professor a friend a lover or even a complete stranger - but when you lock eyes with them you know at that very moment they will affect your life in some profound way  Sometimes things happen to you that may seem horrible painful and unfair at first but in reflection you find that without overcoming those obstacles you would have never realized your potential strength willpower or heart  Illness injury love lost moments of true greatness and sheer stupidity all occur to test the limits of your soul Without these small tests whatever they may be life would be like a smoothly1 paved straight flat road to nowhere It would be safe and comfortable but dull and utterly2 pointless  The people you meet who affect your life and the success and downfalls you experience help to create who you are and who you become Even the bad experiences can be learned from In fact they are sometimes the most important ones  If someone loves you give love back to them in whatever way you can not only because they love you but because in a way they are teaching you to love and how to open your heart and eyes to things  If someone hurts you betrays you or breaks your heart forgive them for they have helped you learn about trust and the importance of being cautious to whom you open your heart  Make every day count Appreciate every moment and take from those moments everything that you possibly can for you may never be able to experience it again Talk to people that you have never talked to before and listen to what they have to say  Let yourself fall in love break free and set your sights high Hold your head up because you have every right to Tell yourself you are a great individual and believe in yourself for if you don"t believe in yourself it will be hard for others to believe in you  You can make anything you wish of your life Create your own life and then go out and live it with absolutely no regrets  And if you love someone tell them for you never know what tomorrow may have in store ceremony But we don't seek out our children and find a quiet moment to tell them what they have meant to us Or what they might expect to face in the years ahead  How fast the years had passed Daniel was born in New Orleans slow to walk and talk and small of stature7 He was the tiniest in his class but he developed a warm outgoing nature and was popular with his peers He was coordinated8 and agile9 and he became adept10 in sports  Baseball gave him his earliest challenge He was an outstanding pitcher11 in Little League expecting to make it big in high school It didn't happen that way He failed to move up from the junior varsity team But he stuck it out Eventually as a senior he moved up to the varsity He won half the team's games At graduation the coach named Daniel the team's most valuable player  His finest hour though came at a school science fair He entered an exhibit showing how the circulatory system works He sketched12 it on cardboard It was primitive13 and crude especially compared to the fancy computerized blinking-light models entered by other students My wife Sara felt embarrassed for him  It turned out that the other kids had not done their own work--their parents had made their exhibits As the judges went on their rounds they found that these other kids couldn't answer their questions Daniel answered every one When the judges awarded the Albert Einstein Plaque14 for the best exhibit they gave it to him  By the time Daniel left for college he stood six feet tall and weighed 170 pounds He was muscular and in superb condition But he never pitched another inning He found that he could not combine athletics16 with academics He gave up baseball for English literature I was sorry that he would not develop his athletic15 talent but proud that he had made such a mature decision He graduated with a "B" average  One day I told Daniel that the great failing in my life had been that I didn't take a year or two off to travel when I finished college  This is the best way to my way of thinking to broaden oneself and develop a larger perspective on life Once I had married and begun working I found that the dream of living in another culture had vanished  Daniel thought about this His Yuppie friends said that he would be insane to put his career on hold But he decided17 it wasn't so crazy After graduation he worked as a waiter a bike messenger and a house painter With the money he earned he had enough to go to Paris #p##e# The night before he was to leave I tossed in bed I was trying to figure out something to say Nothing came to mind Maybe I thought it wasn't necessary to say anything  What does it matter in the course of a lifetime if a father never tells a son what he really thinks of him But as I stood before Daniel I knew that it does matter My father and I loved each other Yet I always regretted never hearing him put his feelings into words and never having the memory of that moment  Now I could feel my palms sweat and my throat tighten18 Why is it so hard to tell a son something from the heart My mouth turned dry I knew I would be able to get out only a few words clearly  "Daniel " I said "if I could have picked I would have picked you " That's all I could say I wasn't sure he understood what I meant Then he came toward me and threw his arms around me For a moment the world and all its people vanished and there was just Daniel and me  He was saying something but my eyes misted over and I couldn't understand what he was saying All I was aware of was the stubble on his chin as his face pressed against mine And then the moment ended and Daniel left for France  I think about him when I walk along the beach on weekends Thousands of miles away somewhere out past the ocean waves breaking on the deserted19 shore he might be scurrying20 across Boulevard Saint Germain strolling through a musty hallway of the Louvre bending an elbow in a Left Bank café  What I said to Daniel was clumsy and trite21 It was nothing And yet it was everything ke hell  He doesn't wish that about me  I don't think he even knows how he makes me feel  I wish he could know  without my telling him  They don't like you to tell them they've made you cry  They don't like you to tell them you're unhappy because of them  If you do  they think you're possessive and exacting8  And then they hate you  They hate you whenever you say anything you really think  You always have to keep playing little games  Oh  I thought we didn't have to; I thought this was so big I could say whatever I meant  I guess you can't  ever  I guess there isn't ever anything big enough for that  Oh  if he would just telephone  I wouldn't tell him I had been sad about him  They hate sad people  I would be so sweet and so gay  he couldn't help but like me  If he would only telephone  If he would only telephone  Maybe that's what he is doing  Maybe he is coming on here without calling me up  Maybe he's on his way now  Something might have happened to him  No  nothing could ever happen to him  I can't picture anything happening to him  I never picture him run over  I never see him lying still and long and dead  I wish he were dead  That's a terrible wish  That's a lovely wish  If he were dead  he would be mine  If he were dead  I would never think of now and the last few weeks  I would remember only the lovely times  It would be all beautiful  I wish he were dead  I wish he were dead  dead  dead  This is silly  It's silly to go wishing people were dead just because they don't call you up the very minute they said they would  Maybe the clock's fast; I don't know whether it's right  Maybe he's hardly late at all  Anything could have made him a little late  Maybe he had to stay at his office  Maybe he went home  to call me up from there  and somebody came in  He doesn't like to telephone me in front of people  Maybe he's worried  just a little  little bit  about keeping me waiting  He might even hope that I would call him up  I could do that  I could telephone him  I mustn't  I mustn't  I mustn't  Oh  God  please don't let me telephone him  Please keep me from doing that  I know  God  just as well as You do  that if he were worried about me  he'd telephone no matter where he was or how many people there were around him  Please make me know that  God  I don't ask YOU to make it easy for me  You can't do that  for all that You could make a world  Only let me know it  God  Don't let me go on hoping  Don't let me say comforting things to myself  Please don't let me hope  dear God  Please don't  I won't telephone him  I'll never telephone him again as long as I live  He'll rot in hell  before I'll call him up  You don't have to give me strength  God; I have it myself  If he wanted me  he could get me  He knows where I am  He knows I'm waiting here  He's so sure of me  so sure  I wonder why they hate you  as soon as they are sure of you  I should think it would be so sweet to be sure  It would be so easy to telephone him  Then I'd know  Maybe it wouldn't be a foolish thing to do  Maybe he wouldn't mind  Maybe he'd like it  Maybe he has been trying to get me  Sometimes people try and try to get you on the telephone  and they say the number doesn't answer  I'm not just saying that to help myself; that really happens  You know that really happens  God  Oh  God  keep me away from that telephone  Keep me away  Let me still have just a little bit of pride  I think I'm going to need it  God  I think it will be all I'll have  Oh  what does pride matter  when I can't stand it if I don't talk to him  Pride like that is such a silly  shabby little thing  The real pride  the big pride  is in having no pride  I'm not saying that just because I want to call him  I am not  That's true  I know that's true  I will be big  I will be beyond little prides #p#    #e# Please  God  keep me from  telephoning him  Please  God  I don't see what pride has to do with it  This is such a little thing  for me to be bringing in pride  for me to be making such a fuss9 about  I may have misunderstood him  Maybe he said for me to call him up  at five  "Call me at five  darling " He could have said that  perfectly10 well  It's so possible that I didn't hear him right  "Call me at five  darling " I'm almost sure that's what he said  God  don't let me talk this way to myself  Make me know  please make me know  I'll think about something else  I'll just sit quietly  If I could sit still  If I could sit still  Maybe I could read  Oh  all the books are about people who love each other  truly and sweetly  What do they want to write about that for  Don't they know it isn't true  Don't they know it's a lie  it's a God damned lie  What do they have to tell about that for  when they know how it hurts  Damn them  damn them  damn them  I won't  I'll be quiet  This is nothing to get excited about  Look  Suppose he were someone I didn't know very well  Suppose he were another girl  Then I'd just telephone and say  "Well  for goodness' sake  what happened to you " That's what I'd do  and I'd never even think about it  Why can't I be casual and natural  just because I love him  I can be  Honestly  I can be  I'll call him up  and be so easy and pleasant  You see if I won't  God  Oh  don't let me call him  Don't  don't  don't  God  aren't You really going to let him call me  Are You sure  God  Couldn't You please relent  Couldn't You  I don't even ask You to let him telephone me this minute  God; only let him do it in a little while  I'll count five hundred by fives  I'll do it so slowly and so fairly  If he hasn't telephoned then  I'll call him  I will  Oh  please  dear God  dear kind God  my blessed Father in Heaven  let him call before then  Please  God  Please  Five  ten  fifteen  twenty  twenty-five  thirty  thirty-five
