The sun is just rising in the morning of another day What can I wish that this day may bring me Nothing that shall make the world or others poorer nothing at the expense of other men; but just those few things which in their coming do not stop me but touch me rather as they pass and gather strength  I wish that this day could bring me a few friends who understand me and yet remain my friends; I also wish that this day could bring me a work to do which has real value  I wish that this day could bring me a mind unafraid to travel even though the trail be not blazed and I wish that this day could bring me an understanding heart  I wish that this day could bring me a sight of the eternal hills and the blue sea stretching to the horizon and of something beautiful which the hands of men have made  I wish that this day could bring me a sense of humor and the power to laugh a little leisure with nothing to do  And I crave1 for a few moments of quiet silent meditation2 in the morning of this day f an edgeThrough living roots awaken12 in my head But I've no spade to follow men like them Between my finger and my thumbThe squat pen rests I'll dig with it  we think whether people will accept us as we are  Instead of living in these unending moments of fear and thoughtless analysis  it is better if we project ourselves with the skills we have with the gloss3 of confidence  With confidence we can portray4 the finer points of our personality in such a way that the places where we do lack are never highlighted  Confidence should glow in us only till the point where our personality is boosted  Above this it leads to over-confidence that is harmful  Over-confidence results in unsatisfied performance levels as the seed of ego5 grows into a plant into our mind  We then imagine and make big talks just to maintain our ego  So guys don't let the seed of ego to germinate6 in your mind  as this seed should be used only for you to live up to your expectations  Confidence is all about being cool  calm and composed  So guys do you have it in you  If you think you don't  boost up yourselves as your mind is your greatest mentor7  You are your greatest helper  out of the far corners of your life just when you need them the most and pack your parachutes for you  The people who go the extra mile  the people who don't look for the kudos9 or the accolades10 or the achievement medal or even the bonus check -- the folks who are just out there packing parachutes
