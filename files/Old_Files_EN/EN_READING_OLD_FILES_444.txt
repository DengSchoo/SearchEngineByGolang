We convince1 ourselves that life will be better after we get married have a baby Then we are frustrated2 that the kids aren't old enough and we'll be more content when they are After that we're frustrated that we have teenagers to deal with We will certainly be happy when they are out of that stage We tell ourselves that our life will be complete when we are able to go on a nice vacation when we retire  The truth is there's no better time to be happy than right now Your life will always be filled with challenges3 It's best to admit this to yourself and decide to be happy There is no way to happiness Happiness is the way So treasure every moment that you have  Stop Waiting Stop waiting until you finish school until you go back to school until you lose ten pounds until you gain ten pounds until you have kids until your kids leave the house until you start work until you retire until you get married until you get divorced4 until Friday night until Sunday morning until spring until summer until fall until winter until you die until you are born again to decide that there is no better time than right now to be happy    lvis' soulful voice he thought he had finally found what he had been looking for--a white man who sounded black Phillips boasted that with Elvis on his label he would make a million dollars  Early Sun recordings4 had Elvis on vocals5 and guitar backed by another guitar and a stand-up bass6 He was playing the kind of material he would one day become famous for: blues7 country songs and gospel hymns8 It was a long way from the white jumpsuits and Las Vegas-style concerts everyone now associates with Elvis But those early recordings helped define the kind of music that the world now knows as Rock 'n' Roll tle that which we have and to long for that which we have not  but it is a great pity that in the world of light and the gift of sight is used only as mere convenience rather that as a means of adding fullness to life
