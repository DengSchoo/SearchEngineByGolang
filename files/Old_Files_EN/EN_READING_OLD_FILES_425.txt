A good companion is better than a fortune for a fortune cannot purchase those elements of character which make companionship a blessing1 The best companion is one who is wiser and better than ourselves for we are inspired by his wisdom and virtue2 to nobler deeds Greater wisdom and goodness than we possess lifts us higher mentally and morally  "A man is known by the companion he keeps " It is always true Companionship of a high order is powerful to develop character Character makes character in the associations of life faster than anything else Purity begets3 purity like begets like; and this fact makes the choice of companion in early life more important even than that of teachers and guardians4  It is true that we cannot always choose all of our companions some are thrust upon us by business or the social relations of life we do not choose them we do not enjoy them; and yet we have to associate with them more or less The experience is not altogether without compensation if there be principle enough in us to bear the strain Still in the main choice of companions can be made and must be made It is not best or necessary for a young person to associate with "Tom Dick and Harry5" without forethought or purpose Some fixed6 rules about the company he or she keeps must be observed The subject should be uttermost in the thoughts and canvassed7 often Companionship is education good or not; it develops manhood or womanhood high or low; it lifts soul upward or drags it downward; it minister to virtue or vice8 There is no half way work about its influence If it ennobles it does grandly if it demoralizes it doest it devilishly It saves or destroys lustily Nothing in the world is surer than this Sow virtue and the harvest will be virtue Sow vice and the harvest will be vice Good companionships help us to sow virtue; evil companionships help us to sow vice  at poetry but I am allowing my mind to control my typing  If you want to achieve what you couldn't haveIf you want to be what you want to beIf you want to do what you can do but aren't doingIf there is a place you want to bebut haven't beenYou will get there become the one and do itCos its all in a state of mind Make up your mind and rule the stars Control your mind and make your fate  I hope this conveys my thoughts with clarity So it's some advice and suggestion to all those eyeballs running through this part of the book to keep their heads on their shoulders without using heads and shoulders And believe me guys; you guys have it in you to make it big Just don't let that teenage iconoclastic11 habit rule over sense  come back home after a lecture trip  when I have seen a lot of people and talked a lot  and am full to the brim with experience that needs to be sorted out  Then for a little while the house feels huge and empty  and I wonder where my self is hiding  It has to be recaptured slowly by watering the plants and perhaps by looking again at each one as though it were a person  It takes a while  as I watch the surf blowing up in fountains at the end of the field  but the moment comes when the world falls away  and the self emerges again from the deep unconscious  bringing back all I have recently experienced to be explored and slowly understood  when I can converse13 again with my hidden powers  and so grow  and so be renewed  till death do us part
