Finding yourself is not really how it works You arent a tendollar bill in last winters coat pocket You are also not lost Your true self is right there buried under cultural conditioning other peoples opinions and inaccurate1 conclusions you drew as a kidthat became your beliefs about who you are Finding yourself is actually returning to yourself An unlearning an excavation2 a remembering who you werebefore the world got its hands on you u were	 	before the world got its hands on you  emind yourself the importance of your dream 		When you are going through tough times		'hold on'		it'll be worth it 		when there's hardship		 'hold on'		it'll be over soon 		when life brings you to your knees		 'hold on'		and rise from within 		when faced with challenges		 'hold on'		Youre strong enough		to battle them 		when faced with distractions		 'hold on'		shake them off		and stay focused 		when faced with negativity		 'hold on'		and smile through the hate 		when these hardships bring tears to your eyes		and you want to quit so bad		 'hold on champ'		you are doing great		just keep moving forward 	r be known by whom  so I won't be forgot  It is not my purpose that l iving in other people's memories

	The sky that has borne me down throughout the whole summer has suddenly lifted  Looking up  I see numerous small-sized clouds  as white assterling silver  neatly4 lined up in the limpidly5 blue sky  The more I gaze at them  the more they look naughty and resemble my innate6 inspirations  How I wish I could bring them down and take a few bites at them 
	               ，    ——                     ，     ，                 ，                。
	 
	I now remember a song I wrote quite a while ago  <I See a Face in the Sky>  but now my mood is quite different from what it was then  and I am also much older –am I  So I stand there looking at those clouds  I want to continue looking at them – until they slowly disappear and are firmly implanted in my mind 
	《          》——           ，         ，        ——    ？         ，      ，         ，            。
	 
	There are more and more passers-by  Some of them look up into the sky  like me – those are romantic types and I bless them; some of them give me a weird7 look and then hurry away – those are people whom I bless too  because they have a purpose to be busy

	This is what life should be like: you have to do something or feel something  Each of these two choices is respectable and cannot be taken lightly  This is just like me at the moment: I now stand my ground  Like an old antelope8  I have to be cool-headed in holding myself in my own territory  next to the earthen wares9 and the wire fences

	Everything will be alright by six o'clock  when by the park gate  there will be vendors10 selling delicious and succulent minced11 pork dumplings  to go with jellied tofu soup thickly dressed with fresh green parsley over brightly red chili12 oil and loosely dotted with chopped  smoked turnips13  And there will also be deep-fried dough14 sticks as hot-tempered as felines15  soybean milk as demure16 as a lovely girlfriend  and crispy-crusted  tender-hearted  green-onion-flavored pancakes as intimate as a bosom17 friend

	Of all the houses tightly lined up here  every window has behind it a story that I have also experienced or that I am interested in hearing; everysleepwalking man cannot help fidgeting like me and every woman in pajamas18 has been loved or is now in love; every old man is rich with experiences and every child fresh; every dog is animated19 and every pigeon keen

	Every morning I do the same thing  although I am now different from before  always dreaming of unusual encounters and always wishing to inspire fervent20 passions  yet always being fooled by peevish21 reality and awakened22 from fanatical visions by such unusual weather  like today  I am now no longer lonely  Right

	This loneliness is like a padded cotton quilt  spread out high in the sky  It can be depressing  descending23  entwining  or uplifting  depending on the change in the number of people who share my room  Beautiful  isn't it  Yes  but a little cruel  I know

	Wow  my Beijing  the one that just had a traffic control yesterday  the one that has had the highest temperature in the country this summer  the one that has revitalized my nerves with a fresh autumn  and the one that has thoroughly24 disordered my life  completely unfolded my story  and carefullyturned me into a new paper to write the story on
