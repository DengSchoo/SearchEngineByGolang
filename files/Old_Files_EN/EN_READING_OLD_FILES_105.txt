We dont meet people by accident Every person you meet will have a role in your life be it big or small Some will help you grow some will hurt you some will inspire you to do better At the same time you are playing some role in their lives as well Know that paths cross for a reason and treat people with significance The best teachers are those who dont tell you how to get there but show the way There is no better joy then helping1 people see a vision for themselves seeing them go to levels higher than they ever would have imagined on their own But that doesnt mean you have to fix them or enable them; instead guide them to the source of their own power Offer them support and motivation as they find their own way and show you what theyre capable of All you have to do is believe in them Never look down on someone unless you are helping them up We like to think of life as a meritocracy so its easy to look down on someone who isnt as successful or accomplished2 or well educated as you are But you have no idea how far that person has already climbed or where they will end up Time could easily reverse your positions so be sure you treat everyone with dignity Appreciate those who have supported you forgive those who have hurt you help those who need you Business is complicated life is complex and leadership is difficult Treat all peopleincluding yourselfwith love and compassion3 and you cant go wrong Treat people the way you want to be treated and life will instantly get better  treated and life will instantly get better dé Nast Traveller 'It might be the most meaningful trip we can take '	 	So next time you think of going on vacation why not take a DNA test first Once you know how far your family has come take the time to holiday back ider that  perhaps  he may have so much difficulty in fighting alone to overcome 	I refused to open up my mind that he  too  must be so confused and needed acceptance 	I was so legalistic and blinded to see that he  too  is a human with frailties6 and shortcomings as much as I do 	While he pushed papa in his wheelchair back and forth7 everyday with the hope that he can walk again  I was brooding up with my resentment8 	I never knew of his difficulties and fatigue9 as he bathed him everyday  did him passive exercises  put him on his potty  took him to bed and everything that I  myself  should be doing as the nurse of the family 	Instead  I blamed him for bringing curse into the family for his stubbornness   	I blamed him for the financial difficulties I was suffering for many years  	I was just too blind and deaf to see that he was not an evil after all 	That he had the character every parents would dream in a child  	A child that would take care of them when they get old and sick 	I was not able to sleep well that night  	I was so overwhelmed with the fact that it is not him that has been wrong all the time  but me and my wicked heart
