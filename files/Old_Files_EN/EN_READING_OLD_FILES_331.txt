The idea of spending a year away from home is something that appeals to nearly everyone So why is taking a gap year still considered the wildcard  For a teenage student the prospect1 of providing for yourself miles away from home can be daunting2 But with an increasing number of gap year companies providing travel and trips abroad to suit any need it is becoming easier to tailor a dream trip  You can also find gap year companies that cover everything frominternships abroad to paid work and volunteering Such companies offer ideas and inspiration3 to kickstart your travelling dream  But gap years don't have to be all about travel You can have a beneficial year out of education and stay right where you are Stephanie Wood wants to be a mental health nurse but with allied4 health courses being some of the most exclusive5 and competitive6 around she is taking a year off from education in order to gain an edge through work experience: "My plan is to get a job that directly relates to my course for the next few months so I can really gain a deeper understanding of the healthcare system Working there over a stretch of time will both give me an impression and insight7 into the working world of nursing - knowledge to help me through university when I choose to go " Choosing to take a year out can help you gain valuable experience as well as give you the opportunity to save up some funds to help you with accommodation when you get to university living costs food - or even just extra cash for freshers week  Gap years aren't for everyone Readjusting to an academic timetable after spending time abroad can be a shock You also need to consider the practicalities from financing8 your gap year to surviving without home comforts  If you do discover that you want to see the world but still go back into education or work in September you're in luck - this summer holiday is an extra long one for school leavers so there's still plenty of time to book your ticket s which stay in style longer at the end of seasons  and buy clothing which fades from style at the beginning of the season  We need to buy much less of the "fashion trend" type of clothing and much more of styles which will be staying around for a longer time  so we can maximize our clothing investment  4  If we haven't worn it in a year  then consider getting rid of it  5  Find a good tailor  Most of the problems with clothing and fit could be eliminated simply by having good tailor  Also  take outfits6 to the tailor for fitting any time we've gained or lost more than 5 lbs  Ever seen someone with a double breasted suit with the button in the wrong place  Or a suit that pinches in the middle  A dress that fits funny  Why not get it tailored professionally so we can look our best  That is what elegance7 is all about  isn't it  6  If we have not used an item (furniture  gadget8  etc ) for over a year  consider donating  selling  or otherwise getting rid of the item  There are some exceptions to this guideline  if collecting a certain item is our passion  but otherwise  this is a healthy guideline to keep our "stuff" simplified  7  Before buying anything  always ask "Do I need this  Do I LOVE this " If the answer is "no"  then don't buy it  As we start to buy proactively  with a plan for bringing new things into our life and donating or selling those things we no longer need  we will find your life will be far more free to spend the time doing what we love  rather than being a slave to fashion
