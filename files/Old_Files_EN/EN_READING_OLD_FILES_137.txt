There are many major decisions to make in our life such as deciding which job to take Choosing a job is never easy Whether it is for students or for those who have already worked in the workplace this is a major decision Standing1 in front of a main crossroad of life we may panic and become confused Maybe you should ask yourself this question first:Does this position meet my values It is undeniable that each of us has our own values Some people like to judge the merits and demerits of different values; but the fact is that most times there are only differences among various values not superiority or inferiority ;Different values should adopt different paths It is the adequate one which is the best If you like stability then do not find a job that pays exactly according to performance It will only overwhelm you If you value the degree of autonomy then do not go to a bureaucratic2 place because you will not be able to stand that place Dont forget It is the adequate one which is the best May you find the future that suits you best ich is the best 		 	May you find the future that suits you best 		rld 		I'm in shock As a successful person or a mother 	 	She just makes living with her so much fun 		What I think about her pursuing her dreams I support it  fully2 I think that she's one of the most talented girls that I've ever met 	  	Was that for me Thank you 	ont have; the weather we long for; the car we dont yet own 		Yet once anything is securely in our possession it disappears 		We only see  in the sense of notice  what isnt there 		The best way to lose ownership of something is to own it  and the surest way to forget your partner exists may be to ensure theyre beside you every night 	ta	When we were apart we can sample the gentle suffering of loneliness over the intense rage of suffocation6 	5	We never have to find out how much it can tarnish7 love to be with someone who has a different idea of a cutlery drawer or the correct way to suspend a towel 		Too often when were cohabiting we locate the difficulty of our relationships in a very erroneous place:				We think that it is the wrong person weve mistakenly got together with 						rather than keeping in mind that were with a pretty right person trying to do an exceptionally tricky8 thing: share a home 						It may in the end  strangely  just be a lot easier to love than to share a bathroom 						Our love stories are suffering from a mistaken cultural hierarchy9 						Just as the book is often wrongly thought more important than the essay so the live-in relationship is too readily assumed to be superior to the long-range version 						And yet without ever meaning to do so the long-distance relationship may simply despite all its evident challenges 						throw up some of the absolutely ideal conditions for true love to thrive 						We should be wise to imbibe10 a few of the lessons life normally only teaches us when theyre in Sydney and youre in Vancouver						and carefully import them into our lives even with the people unfortunate enough to be right next to us 			e of the short time we had together
	 
	I learned so much from Kai
	 
	about how to truly live all the days we are given here 
	 
	Lessons on kindness  generosity7   hope  and good cheer seemed to flow freely from her daily life 
	 
	I think most of all she taught me that joy like love is quite contagious8
	 
	and that I should always strive to be a carrier of them both 
	 
	May the same be said for all of us 
	 
	Thanks Kai
