A Ball to Roll Aroundby Robert G AllmanGI lost my sight when I was four years old by falling off a box car in a freight yard in Atlantic City and landing on my head Now I am thirtytwo I can vaguely1 remember the brightness of sunshine and what colour red is It would be wonderful to see again but a calamity2 can do strange things to people 432It occurred to me the other day that I might not have come to love life as I do if I hadn t been blind I believe in life now I am not so sure that I would have believed in it so deeply otherwise I don t mean that I would prefer to go without my eyes I simply mean that the loss of them made me appreciate the more what I had left Life I believe asks a continuous series of adjustments to reality The more readily a person is able to make these adjustments the more meaningful his own private world becomes The adjustment is never easy I was bewildered and afraid But I was lucky My parents and my teachers saw something in me a potential to live you might call it which I didnt see and they made me want to fight it out with blindness The hardest lesson I had to learn was to believe in myself That was basic If I hadnt been able to do that I would have collapsed3 and become a chair rocker on the front porch for the rest of my life When I say belief in myself I am not talking about simply the kind of selfconfidence that helps me down an unfamiliar4 staircase alone That is part of it But I mean something bigger than that: an assurance that I am despite imperfections a real positive person that somewhere in the sweeping5 intricate pattern of people there is a special place where I can make myself fit It took me years to discover and strengthen this assurance It had to start with the most elementary things Onc e a man gave me an indoor baseball I thought he was mocking me and I was hurt I can t use this I said Take it with you he urged me and roll it around The words stuck in my head Roll it around By rolling the ball I could hear where it went This gave me an idea how to achieve a goal I had thought impossible: playing baseball At Philadelphia s Overbrook School for the Blind I invented a successful variation of baseball We called it ground ball All my life I have set ahead of me a series of goals and then tried to reach them one at a time I had to learn my limitations It was no good to try for something I knew at the start was wildly out of reach because that only invited the bitterness of failure I would fail sometimes anyway but on the average I made progress mes anyway but on the average I made progress 	 	 got work to do tomorrow 		 	Neverthelesssome are willing to hold dear to love At the moment Mitsuha and Taki met with each other tears welled from our eyes 		 	What had caught my interest so much is now a mystery to me But at a point I was inexplicably8 drawn to the events surrounding that comet9 		 	I feel like I am always searching for something for someone 		 	She liked him so her heart was hurt deeply when he went for the date that she designed 		 	He adored10 her so he spared no efforts to save her life when he knew she would die for the fall of the comet 		 	Sadly although he kept repeating her name he still forgot it 		 	Although he failed to write down her name the I love you remained on her hand Perhaps there are bounds between peoplewhich is hard to explain When Taki turned around to ask Mitsuha whether they had met before they asked at the same time  whats your name  It might be a fiction story but the feeling is true 	----	 	Your Name is cure for those who have lost faith in true love Whenever we are overwhelmed11 by some invisible pressure we crave12 for the love we once had we crave for the person that we once eat dinner and watch movies together We all need someone to share things with in our life We are on a great journey 		 	We need someone to be there for us when we are tired and want to give up Whenever we realize that there is someone we miss so much deep inside take a deep breath and carry on for I believe there is always a shelter for my soul So there are plenty of strong minded people who are brave enough to fight for love once more time no matter what they met before or how heart-broken they were All the seeking is for happiness See among all these people we are able to find each other 		 	For this time I strongly believe that there will be the one who keeps searching for us from dawn to dusk To you please believe that we must reunite in the future even if I forget your name One thing is certain If we see each other we will know 	sure enough  they found the six pots  one after another  each one filled to the brim with gold coins

	When Hassan was alive  Jehdi often came to visit him and greeted his friend with the words  "Well  Hassan  how are you  I have come to see what has happened to my dream " And then the two comrades patted each other on the back laughing  But every time Jehdi returned home sadder  for he knew that he could never buy back his dream
