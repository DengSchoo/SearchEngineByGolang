Everybody has blue days These are miserable1 days when you feel lousy grumpy lonely and utterly2 exhausted3 Days when you feel small and insignificant4 when everything seems just out of reach You can't rise to the occasion Just getting started seems impossible (This is not always such a bad thing ) You feel frustrated5 anxious which can induce a nail-biting frenzy6 that can escalate7 into a triple-chocolate-mud-cake-eating frenzy in a blink of an eye On blue days you feel like you're floating in an ocean of sadness You're about to burst into tears at any moment and you don't even know why Ultimately you feel like you are wandering through life without purpose It donesn't take much to bring on a blue day You might just wake up not feeling or looking your best find some new wrinkles put on a little weight or get a huge pimple8 on your nose You could forget your date's name or have an embarrassing photograph published You might get dumped divorced or fired make fool of yourself in public be afflicted9 with a demeaning nickname or just have a plain old bad-hair day Maybe work is a pain in the butt10 You're under major pressure to fill someone else's shoes your boss is picking on you and everyone in the office is driving you crazy Whatever the reason you're convinced that someone up there doesn't like you Oh what to do what to do  Well if you're like most people you'll hide behind a flimsy belief that everything will sort itself out Then you will spend the rest of your life looking over your shoulder waiting for everything to go wrong all over again All the while becoming crusty and cynical11 or a pathetic sniveling victim Until you get so depressed12 that you lie down and beg the earth to swallow you up or even worse become addicted13 to Billy Joel songs This is crazy because you're only young once and you're never old twice  Now just relax Take some deep breaths Try to meditate14 if you can Or go for a walk to clear your head Accept the fact that you'll have to go of some emotional baggage Never hang back Get out there and go for it After all isn't that what life is all about Mrs  Leland Stanford walked away  traveling to Palo Alto  California where they established the university that bears their name -- a memorial to a son that Harvard no longer cared about  You can easily judge the character of others by how they treat those who can do nothing for them or to them
