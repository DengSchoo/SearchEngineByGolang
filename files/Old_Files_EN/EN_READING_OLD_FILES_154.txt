There are two types of people in this world The first type is like foxes The other type is like hedgehogs A fox knows many trivial things And they can do a lot of stuff They are not among the top experts of any fields But they know some things in almost every field They understand how complicated the world is and they integrate themselves with this complicated system deeply They often jump from one field into another and bring there some sparks of innovation On the other hand a hedgehog knows only one important thing They tend to induct every complicated thing they encounter into the only system that they understand Because of this they are usually only involved in a limited number of fields But they usually know these fields very well This is just like the hedgehogs in the nature No matter what situation they come to meet the only solution they choose will be curling up into a ball This is not a clever choice but it really works in front of most dangers So which one are you Are you a fox Or are you a hedgehog e you 	 	Are you a fox Or are you a hedgehog 	 May you be young forever ve Now 		I mean who even does that 		Getting laid off can be a blessing6 in disguise 		Being a starving artist only works if you actually make art 		Always be kind to your family You'll need each other when things get tough 		Stop panicking Being a single mom is an incredible thing 		I was 22 I had this little kid named him Vladimir 	22	He's 14 now he makes me proud So proud 	14	Dear 36-year-old stop caring so much about what other people think They're not thinking about you at all Signed a 47-year-old 	3647	Dear 47-year-old a mid-life crisis does not look good on you Signed a 48-year-old 	4748	Dear 48-year-old always tell the truth Except when it comes to your online dating profile 	48	Dear 51-year-old one cat is enough cats Signed a 53-year-old 	5153	Dear 53-year-old it's never too late to try something new 	53	I've decided7 to take my husband's Corvette and go to racing8 school If Paul Newman can do it why can't I 	·	Dear 72-year-old spend all your money Otherwise your kids are going to do it for you Sincerely an 85-year-old 	7285	Dear 85-year-old  Indulge your sweet tooth you'll need dentists soon anyway My late wife made the best apple pie that you could ever find 	85    	When she cut the pieces she would cut small ones and when she came to me she would cut a big one 		Dear 88-year-old cultivate younger friends Otherwise yours will all die off Sincerely 91 years old 	8891	Dear 91-year-old don't listen to other people's advice Nobody knows what the hell they're doing Signed a 93-year old 	9193	Just do your own thing That's the way I see it 		The popular kids they're so shallow They like hashtags and pop culture and it's like I don't care That's never going to be relevant in the future 		If your babysitter hates feet do a handstand and then put your feet right in their face 		Have you ever done that before 		No but I'm willing to 		Dear 70-year-old stay weird 	70	Signed a 72-year-old 	72	I think that went good 		 s the current job market  Many young people who came to the first-tier cities ended up in devastating6 failures 	                                       	And you won t know these people s stories 	               er brothers  both of whom opted5 for the factory scene rather than education  But I could see this ambition having an ending point  as if it were mistakenly siphoned into me and would be sucked out if I spent too much time in my small town  I could see in my mind's eye how discouraged I would get living at home for two more years under my parents' ironclad rule  either getting frustrated6 at the extension  or finding more value in the attention from boys  ending up pregnant and working at the nearby gas station  Not my idea of a future

	So every day after school  my dad and I had blown out fights about where I would go to college  His logic7 was very sound  especially considering where I stand now  three years after graduation with debt up to my eyeballs   but I just knew l would get nowhere staying in my hometown  He threatened to give me no financial help at all  and I said that was fine  I would be able to get enough loans

	Eventually I signed my family up for a tour of the state university  My dad and I toured campus  and even though it was very cold  my dad fell in love - or at the very least seemed very enthusiastic about every corner of the campus

	I could tell he was softened8 by this visit  but the fights about where I was going to get the money continued until the day I packed everything up into our minivan   It was then  at breakfast before we made our journey down  that my dad said he was proud of me  He hadn't thought I would actually leave  and he was impressed  As my parents dropped me off at my dorm room  my mom started crying hysterically9   and even my dad teared up  kissing me on the forehead  which was the first time I could remember getting hugged and kissed by them in years

	At this point  my relationship with my parents changed  No longer were they the disciplinarians but they became confidants   advisors10 and an excellent support system  and I became an adult  Sometimes I still expect to get yelled at for my decisions  but they've done phenomenally well to leave me to my own life  and to just be happy when I actually call home  No matter what happens now  I know standing11 my ground on where to go for school has been the best decision of my life  as I have gained both a good education and a precious life experience I never would have been exposed to had I taken any other road
