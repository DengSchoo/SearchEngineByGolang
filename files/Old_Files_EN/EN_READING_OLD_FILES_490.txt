Fill me with the fruits of your Spirit Lord  Fill me with love so that I seek to understand and appreciate the rich variety and diversity of life that surrounds me  Fill me with joy so that I celebrate your presence in each and every moment I am on this earth  Fill me with peace so that I know how to ease those angry and sometimes violent urges that well up inside of me  Fill me with patience so that I stop rushing long enough to witness your miraculous1 work taking place all around me (and within me ) Fill me with kindness so that I take the extra time to help the one in need even when it isn't convenient for me  Fill me with faithfulness so that I place my mind heart and all that I do in the service of your Gospel  Fill me with gentleness so that others know that I believe in a God who loves and cares for all people  Fill me with self-control so that I act not on my impulses and urges but rather on my beliefs and values which are rooted in you  Fill me with these fruits of your spirit Lord his master's side  He will kiss the hand that has no food to offer  He will lick the sores and wounds that come in the encounter with the roughness of the world  He guards the sleep of his pauper5 master as if he were a prince  When all other friends desert  he remains6  When riches take wings and reputation falls to pieces  he is as constant in his love as the sun in its journey through the heavens  If fortune drives the master forth7  an outcast in the world  friendless and homeless  the faithful dog asks no higher privilege than that of accompanying him to guard him against danger  to fight against his enemies  And when the last scene of all comes and death takes its master in its embrace and the body is laid away in the cold ground  no matter if all other friends pursue their way  there  by his graveside will the noble dog be found  his head between his paws  his eyes sad but open in alert watchfulness8 faithful and true even to death
