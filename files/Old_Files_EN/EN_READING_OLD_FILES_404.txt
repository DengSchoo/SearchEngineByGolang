One day an expert in time management was speaking to a group of students and to drive home a point used an illustration those students will never forget  As he stood in front of the group of overachievers he said "OK time for a quiz " He pulled out a one-gallon wide-mouth jar and set it on the table in front of him He also produced about a dozen fist-sized rocks and carefully placed them one at a time into the jar When the jar was filled to the top and no more rocks would fit inside he asked "Is this jar full " Everyone in the class yelled "Yes " The time management expert replied "Really " He reached under the table and pulled out a bucket of gravel1 He dumped some gravel in and shook the jar causing pieces of gravel to work themselves down into the spaces between the big rocks He then asked the group once more "Is this jar full " By this time the class was on to him "Probably not " one of them answered "Good " he replied He reached under the table and brought out a bucket of sand He started dumping the sand in the jar and it went into all of the spaces left between the rocks and the gravel Once more he asked the question "Is this jar full " "No " the class shouted Once again he said "Good " Then he grabbed a pitcher2 of water and began to pour it in until the jar was filled to the brim Then he looked at the class and asked "What is the point of this illustration " One eager student raised his hand and said "The point is no matter how full your schedule is if you try really hard you can always fit some more things in it " "No " the speaker replied "that's not the point The truth this illustration teaches us is if you don't put the big rocks in first you'll never get them in at all What are the 'big rocks' in your life Time with your loved ones your education your dreams a worthy3 cause teaching or mentoring4 others Remember to put these big rocks in first or you'll never get them in at all "of the full moon "Yes "cessary  that their coffee is served to them as they like it  And I want a wife who knows that sometimes I need a night out by myself  I want a wife who is sensitive to my *ual needs  a wife who makes love passionately4 and eagerly when I feel like it  a wife who makes sure that I am satisfied  And  of course  I want a wife who will not demand *ual attention when I am not in the mood for it  I want a wife who assumes the complete responsibility for birth control  because I do not want more children  I want a wife who will remain *ually faithful to me so that I do not have to clutter5 up my intellectual life with jealousies6  And I want a wife who understands that my *ual needs may entail7 more than strict adherence8 to monogamy  I must  after all  be able to relate to people as fully9 as possible  If  by chance  I find another person more suitable as a wife than the wife I already have  I have the liberty to replace my present wife with another one  Naturally  I will expect a fresh  new life; my wife will take the children and be solely10 responsible for them so that I am left free  When I am through with school and have a job  I want my wife to quit working and remain at home so that my wife can more fully and completely take care of a wife's duties  My God  who wouldn't want a wife
