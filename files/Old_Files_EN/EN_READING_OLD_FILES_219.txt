We all have one of these Some of us have more than one By which I mean a friend who we may laugh with cry with work side by side with but who we know way deep down in our gut1 in the place where intuition lies doesnt wish the best for us This friend may be a very good person in all sorts of ways She may not even mean to hurt us But hurt she does So it went with Helen my friend of 15 years One afternoon Helen came by the house for a visit She brought along a woman I didnt know My son was having a big old toddler tantrum at the moment and I was delighted by the tantrum He had been terribly ill as an infant and had very nearly died I was all for normal toddler behavior He was redfaced screaming stamping his little feet Alive Healthy As I scooped2 him up in my arms I overheard Helens companion ask her how old my boy was And I caught Helens reflection in a mirror as she mouthed: Hes two rolled her eyes and shook her head It was a dreadful moment a reckoning a realization3 of her judgment4 her lack of empathy I called her on it eventually But what was there really to say She apologized profusely5 I accepted that apology but I knew that things would never be the same between us Helen was part of my learning curve about who can be safely let into my inner circle Lesson learned ner circle Lesson learned ecome disillusioned5 They do not want to work on a relationship They unrealistically expect it to be spring all the time They blame their partners and give up They do not realize that love is not always easy; sometimes requires hard work under a hot sun In the summer season of love we need to nurture our partner needs as well as ask for and get the love we need It doesnt happen automatically 	 	The autumn of love	 	As result of tending the garden during the summer we get to harvest results of our hard work Fall has come It is a golden time--- rich and fulfilling We experience a more mature love that accepts and understands our partners imperfections as well as our own It is a time of thanksgiving and sharing Having worked hard during the summer we can relax and enjoy the love we have created 	 	The winter of love	 	Then weather changes again and winter comes During the cold barren months of winter all of our nature pulls back within itself It is a time of rest reflection and renewal6 	 	It is a time and relationships we experience only unresolved pain or our shadow self It is when our lid comes off and our painful feeling emerge It is a time of solitary7 growth when who need to look more to ourselves than to our partners for love and fulfillment It is a time of healing This is the time when men hibernate8 in their caves and women sink to the bottom of their wells 	 	After loving and healing ourselves through the dark winter of love then spring inevitably9 returns Once again we are blessed with the feeling of hope love and an abundance of possibilities Based on our inner healing and soul searching of our winter journey we are then able to open our hearts and feel springtime of love 	 		 		 		 		 		 		 	 	 		 		 		 		 	t ever -- that's just what parents do  But after seeing Kendall perform  I know she's one of the best  even though she didn't make it into the Top 24 
	 
	Kendall is eighteen now  living every day to its fullest  She's recorded a CD with some of John Mellencamp's band members  She's also on CMT's Music City Madness for an original song and video  and is having some good success  I'm absolutely sure she's going to make it big some day  Kendall just puts it all in God's hands 
	 
	When she was a little girl trying hard to be strong  she looked up at me  her big eyes brimming with tears  and asked me why she had to have Tourette's Syndrome  My heart ached to make the world right for my child  But I looked right back at her and told her the truth as I see it 
	 
	"Kendall  God gave you a pure heart  an angelic voice  a strong mind  and a beautiful presence  With all of that  he had to make it fair for everyone else "
