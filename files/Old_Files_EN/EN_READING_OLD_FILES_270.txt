Today before you think of saying an unkind word   Think of someone who can't speak   Before you complain about the taste of your food   Think of someone who has nothing to eat   Before you complain about your husband or wife   Think of someone who's crying out to God for a companion   Today before you complain about life   Think of someone who went too early to heaven   Before you complain about your children   Think of someone who desires children but they're barren   Before you argue about your dirty house someone didn't clean or sweep   Think of the people who are living in the streets   Before whining1 about the distance you drive   Think of someone who walks the same distance with their feet   And when you are tired and complain about your job   Think of the unemployed2 the disabled and those who wished they had your job   But before you think of pointing your finger or condemning3 another   Remember that not one of us is without sin and we all answer to one maker4   And when depressing thoughts seem to get you down   Put a smile on your face and thank God you're alive and still around   Life is a gift   Enjoy it   Celebrate it   And fulfill5 it   And while you want to give love to someone today   Love someone with what you do and the words you say  Love is not meant to be kept locked inside of us and hidden   So give it away" Give love to someone today "" a small flock of cedar14 waxwings another migratory species of songbirds stopped for a rest in a nearby tree only two blocks from our house  Man has always been fascinated with the arrival of spring King Solomon weighed in on it when he wrote these words from his "Song" in the Old Testament15: "See The winter is past; the rains are over and gone Flowers appear on the earth; the season of singing has come the cooing of doves is heard in our land The fig16 tree forms its early fruit; the blossoming vines spread their fragrance17 " The arrival of spring has always marked a rebirth of sorts not just for nature but also for us humans It is a time of awakening18 a time to forget the old and to embrace the new  For most kids it's simply a time when they can play outside longer riding their new bicycles and skateboards or shooting hoops19 in driveway basketball courts For some adults it can be a serious time a release from the seasonal20 depression caused by the reduced hours of sunlight during the dark months of winter  But for most of us it is a release from the mundane21 things that after three months have added up to the point where we are all just ready for a change You know: things like having to wear layers of heavy clothing white-knuckle drives to work on icy roads and leaving home mornings in the dark only to drive back home again in darkness later the same afternoon  The crocus and daffodils will soon start peeking22 their heads above last year's pine bark nuggets and what's left of the winter snow still piled in the beds under the white pines out by the road  They are yet another prelude to the appearance of more flowers and birds: the warblers and the tanagers that will shortly appear in the trees around my home  I can't wait to inhale23 the aromas24 of things like the warming earth new mown grass and fresh piles of damp cedar mulch And I am looking forward to that first morning when I can sit outside on my deck with a cup of coffee and feel comfortable without having to don a fleece or a heavy woolen25 shirt  Whatever your passion in life take time like the busy King Solomon to pause from it for a moment over the next few weeks and just sit and watch and enjoy the spectacle of spring unfold before your eyes  And give thanks   After I got the note  I wondered if he had been writing things for me  From then on I tried to see Jimmy through the window  It was my only way of looking into his world  I wondered if my admirer had ever done the same  One evening  I got a call from Christy  "I think I know who your admirer is " she shrieked13  My heart pounded  "Who " "You're not going to believe this  but I think its Russell Moore  At church I overheard14 him say you were cute  Can you believe it " There was a long silence  "Well  aren't you excited " she asked  "I guess " I said  "Who do you want it to be " she asked  I couldn't think of anyone but Jimmy so I said that I didn't know  Later that evening  I considered writing Jimmy a letter  I thought I could be an 'admirer' myself  He thinks I hate him  He thinks I’m like everyone else  What if I don't get the chance to tell him different  But I decided15 against it  I guess I wasn't as brave as my secret admirer was  It was strange  I wondered if I was falling in love with him  All of a sudden I wanted to see him  talk to him  hear his voice  I wondered why I felt that way  The next day was the day of the prom  I woke up that morning feeling nervous  I could've cared less about the dance  it was where I was going afterwards that I was thinking of  The decorations at the dance were beautiful  The music was great  But I couldn't enjoy myself  I was restless up until I left at 11:45  I began walking towards the park  Although it was May  it was a cool evening  A breeze stirred the branches of the trees  I wrapped my jacket tight around me  Then I spotted16 a small park bench where I decided to wait  Thirty minutes passed and he still hadn't arrived  Maybe no one was coming in the first place  I thought  maybe he doesn't exist  I let a few tears slip out  then told myself I wouldn’t cry  Just then I got a call on my cell phone from Christy  She sounded upset  "Marly " she shouted  "Jimmy McAllister was in an accident by the school  He's hurt really bad " "Oh my God " I exclaimed choking on tears  "I'll be right there " I tried to run  blinded by tears  I tripped a few times but finally made it back to the school  I saw that his truck had slid into a ditch alongside17 the school  They were carrying Jimmy into the ambulance on a stretcher  I don't know what made me do it  but I looked inside his badly damaged truck  Laying on the seat was a red rose  Attached to the rose was a card that read  'for Marly '
