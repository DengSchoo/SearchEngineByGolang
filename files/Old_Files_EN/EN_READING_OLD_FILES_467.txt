My parents owned six books between them  Two of those were Bibles and the third was a concordance to the Old and New Testaments1  The fourth was The House At Pooh Corner  The fifth  The Chatterbox Annual 1923 and the sixth  Malory s Morte d'Artliur  I found it necessary to smuggle2 books in and of the house and I cannot claim too much for the provision of an outside toilet when there is no room of one's own  It was on the toilet that I first read Freud and D  H  Lawrence  and perhaps that was the best place  after all  We kept a rubber torch hung on the cistern4  and I had to divide my money from a Saturday job  between buying books and buying batteries  My mother knew exactly how long her Ever Readys would last if used only to illuminate5 the hap3 that separated the toilet paper from its   Once I had tucked the book back down my knickers to get it indoors again  I find somewhere to hide it  and anyone with a single bed  standard size  and paperbacks6  standard size  will discover that seventy seven can be accommodated per layer under the mattress7  But as my collection grew  I began to worry that my mother might notice that her daughter's bed was rising visibly  One day she did  She burned everything  I had been brought up to memorize very long Bible passages  and when I left home and was supporting myself so that I could continue my education  I fought off loneliness and fear by reciting  In the funeral parlor8 I whispered Donne to the embalming9 fluids and Marvell to the corpses10  Later  I found that Tennyson's 'Lady of Shalott' had a soothing11  because rhythmic12  effect on the mentally disturbed  Among the disturbed I numbered myself at that time  The healing power of art is not a rhetorical fantasy  Fighting to keep language  language became my sanity13 and my strength  It still is  and I know of no pain that art cannot assuage14  For some  music  for some  pictures  for me  primarily  poetry  whether found in poems or in prose  cuts through noise and hurt  opens the wound to clean it  and then gradually teaches it to heal itself  Wounds need to be taught to heal themselves  The psyche15 and the spirit do not share the instinct of damaged body  Healing is automatically triggered nor is danger usually avoided  Since we put ourselves in the way of hurt it seems logical to put ourselves in the way of healing  Art has more work to do than ever before but it can do that work  In a self-destructive society like our own  it is unsurprising that art as a healing force is despised  For myself  when I returned to my to my borrowed room night after night  and there were my books  I felt relief and exuberance16  not hardship and exhaustion17  I intended to avoid the fate of Jude the Obscure  although a reading of that book was a useful warning  What I wanted did not belong to me by right and whilst it could not be refused tome in quite same way  we still have subtle punishments for anyone who insists on what they are and what they want  Walled inside the little space marked out for by family and class  it was the limitless world of imagination that it possible for me to scale the sheer face of other people's assumptions  Inside books there is perfect space and it is that space which allows the reader to escape from the problems of gravity
