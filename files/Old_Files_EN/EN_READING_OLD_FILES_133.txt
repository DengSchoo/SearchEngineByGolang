Number one lazy innovation Theres a common saying that necessity is the mother of innovation Every new invention aims to satisfy some kind of need People needed to see without wearing glasses so someone invented contacts People needed to communicate with friends and family from far far away so someone invented phones I say the word need pretty loosely more often than not these inventions dont really change our lives Its not a lifeordeath situation if we dont have a TV or a recliner chair People want these inventions because they make their lives easier Now the more you have the less work you have to do For example plenty of people live their whole lives without a microwave There are lots of other ways to cook your food but who wants to expend1 the effort if they dont have to Wouldnt you rather just press a button and wait two minutes Of course my point is that laziness and innovation go hand in hand and not just because customers are lazy Inventors are often the laziest people out there Well just look at Benjamin Franklin He famously called himself the laziest man in the world He said he would invent things simply to save himself a little bit of time and effort He was tired of working so hard when he went swimming so he invented flippers He only created bifocals because he was too lazy to switch between different pairs of glasses Lazy people make fantastic inventors since theyre always looking for the fastest and most efficient way to get things done Their laziness motivates them to find creative solutions Theyll improve streamline2 and automate3 so they can spend less time doing things that they dont like You can and should use your laziness the same way When youre unwilling4 to do something start looking for ways to save time Not only is it more fun but youll also find yourself more motivated to succeed Think of it like driving to work in the morning Now your normal route may only take you thirty minutes but theres nothing you hate more than sitting in traffic so you discover a shortcut5 You realize if you cut down a few side streets that you can completely skip the usual congestion6 Even if you only end up saving say five minutes your commute7 will feel significantly shorter and more exciting Finding a workaround also gives you a unique sense of accomplishment8 It feels good to know that youre working smarter and not harder So the next time youre not in the mood to work use that laziness to your advantage 230 5Number two listen to your thoughts Even when youre avoiding your responsibilities your mind is actively9 thinking about them You may discover you have a hard time enjoying whatever youre distracting yourself with Your mind is too focused on your laziness to prioritize anything else You end up feeling irritated and guilty because as much as you want to forget well you cant People are laziest when theyre in denial Imagine you have a paper due next week In the back of your mind you know its gonna be a ton of work You still have to gather sources find quotes write your thesis you know the list goes on and on Yet here you are spending hours on social media You convince yourself you still have plenty of time but your gut10 is telling you otherwise Whenever you continue thinking about one thing it means its time to get started Not tomorrow not in a few hours right now Because this thought isnt just popping up out of nowhere Its the productive part of your brain telling you the right thing to do So dont try to block it out with TV or video games You can use the same trick when you have a completely packed todo list If youre struggling to figure out what to do first tackle the task that you cant stop thinking about The longer you try to ignore it the more frustrated11 youre gonna feel Youll never feel satisfied until you get that bigticket item out of your head Number three the power of reliability12 Even if youre great about setting new goals you may have a hard time following through You might make a todo list and lay out specific concrete steps but what stops you from bailing14 at the last minute Lets say you want to start working out You research exercises you buy gym clothes and you even get a gym membership Yet you never actually show up You end up watching TV or playing video games because well you can If you decide to skip the gym for the tenth time youre not affecting anyone but yourself Theres no one there to hold you accountable You should use reliability to motivate yourself to do things that you normally wouldnt So the next time you plan on going to the gym ask one of your friends to meet you there That way someone else will be counting on you to show up Theyll expect you to follow through so if you dont you wont get off scotfree like you did before Reliability is effective for a number of reasons but trust is a big one You show up because you dont want to blow off your friend You invited them to the gym so you cant just bail13 because youre feeling lazy Sitting around watching Netflix is a pretty terrible reason to damage a friendship Reliability also motivates you because you want your friend to think highly of you You want them to see you as someone who takes their goals seriously So when youre on your own its easier to fail because no one has to know about it Your friends and family wont have a different opinion of you if you dont go But now your friend will see firsthand whether youre following through or not So you show up to make sure you leave a good impression For the same reason youre more likely to actually try while youre there You cant just leave after five minutes or sit on your phone the whole time Sitting there watching your friend do what theyre supposed to do will motivate you to follow suit Finally reliability can make things more fun It gives you someone to talk to which relieves anxiety and stress Your friend might also be more experienced so they can help you get the most out of whatever youre doing If youre struggling to find motivation on your own hey theres no shame in calling for backup The simple fact that someone else is involved will jumpstart your work ethic15 105Number four undermine your fears Sometimes our laziness isnt really laziness You might procrastinate16 or avoid doing something because well youre worried about what will happen when you try You might have set your expectations way too high You might feel an overwhelming amount of pressure to succeed This can make even the smallest chores feel like huge responsibilities You end up running away because you cant fail at something that you never actually do Now to avoid this kind of laziness check your expectations at the door In other words when you start a project you only have one job and thats to start Dont be afraid of making something terrible just begin working on the first thing that pops into your mind This gets you past that initial roadblock Every project is way less intimidating17 when youre already halfway18 done This is the same reason that teachers encourage their students to write rough drafts You make something rough and imperfect to get an idea of where youre headed Yeah it wont be very good because its not supposed to be There arent any expectations or pressure but youll find that things seem a lot more doable afterwards So when youre feeling lazy dont be afraid to get a little messy Improving something bads a whole lot easier than making something perfect from scratch Number five dress for productivity Where are you the laziest Well if youre like most people you probably feel lethargic19 whenever youre trying to work or study in your room And your clothes maybe the biggest reason why Now everyone knows its a whole lot more comfortable to work in sweatpants or pajamas20 If youre gonna spend all day doing something that you dont want to you might as well be comfy right The truth is your clothes can directly affect your habits This is one of the biggest reasons why so many companies make their employees dress up for work even if they arent interacting with customers Your brain naturally associates your habits with your environment Think about studying in your room versus21 studying in the library the latter is way more efficient because your brain doesnt see your room as a workspace So when youre in your room your brain unconsciously thinks about relaxation22 and sleep because thats what its used to doing But the library puts you in a different mental space this new environment primes your brain to work and think harder than it would anywhere else Clothes work the exact same way What are you usually doing when you wear sweatpants Chances are you arent taking tests or going to meetings youre probably playing video games or watching TV So thats what your brain thinks about when youre wearing them The lazier your clothes are the lazier youll feel To overcome this kind of laziness change into clothes that help you focus Dont worry you dont have to wear a suit and tie You should choose something you wouldnt mind wearing out into the world This is an especially helpful tip for students and people who work from home Yeah its tempting23 to lounge around all day in your comfiest outfit24 but you need to tell your brain when its time to shift gears A change of clothing is an easy and effective way to do just that outfit24 but you need to tell your brain when it's time to shift gears A change of clothing is an easy and effective way to do just that
