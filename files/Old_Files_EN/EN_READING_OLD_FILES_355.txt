"Do you like my dress " she asked of a passing stranger " My mommy made it just for me " She said with a tear in her eye  "Well I think it's very pretty so tell me little one why are you crying " With a quiver1 in her voice the little girl answered " After Mommy made me this dress she had to go away " "Well now " said the lady "with a little girl like you waiting for her I'm sure she'll be right back " "No Ma'am you don't understand " said the child through her tears "my daddy said she's up in heaven now with Grandfather " Finally the woman realized what the child meant and why she was crying Kneeling2 down she gently cradled3 the child in her arms and together they cried for the mommy that was gone  Then suddenly the little girl did something that the woman thought was a bit strange She stopped crying stepped back from the woman and began to sing She sang so softly4 that it was almost a whisper5 It was the sweetest sound the woman had ever heard almost like the song of a very small bird  After the child stopped singing she explained to the lady "My mommy used to sing that song to me before she went away and she made me promise to sing it whenever I started crying and it would make me stop " "See " she exclaimed6 "it did and now my eyes are dry " As the woman turned to go the little girl grabbed7 her sleeve8 "Ma'am can you stay just a minute I want to show you something " "Of course " she answered "what do you want me to see " Pointing to a spot on her dress she said "Right here is where my mommy kissed my dress and here " pointing to another spot "and here is another kiss  and here and here Mommy said that she put all those kisses on my dress so that I would have her kisses for every booboo'that made me cry " Then the lady realized that she wasn't just looking at a dress no she was looking at a motherwho knew that she was going away and would not be there to kiss away the hurts that she knew her daughter would get  So she took all the love she had for her beautiful little girl and put them into this dress that her child now so proudly wore  She no longer saw a little girl in a simple dress She saw a child wrappedin her mother's love rt  We hurt ourselves with comparisons to others but we can't seem to stop Remember that each life must be judged on its own terms
