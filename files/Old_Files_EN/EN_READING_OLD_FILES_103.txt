The problem is I think in most of our lives the root suffering is following that brain noise and listening to that brain noise and actually identifying with it as if its who you are Thats just the noise your brain makes you know and more often than not it probably doesnt have much to say thats going to help you It started to feel like maybe the thing youre most scared of is exactly what you should do maybe this is actually what you should push yourself into And this is just happening in a chaotic1 form But the hunt for the moment you know the hunt to be present thats the goal And I think back to all the amount of time I probably spent suffering as a result of brain noise ult of brain noise man was amazed3 These animals could at any time break free from their bonds but because they believed they couldn't they were stuck right where they were 	 	Like the elephants how many of us go through life hanging onto a belief that we cannot do something simply because we failed at it once before 	 	Failure is part of learning4; we should never give up the struggle in life  means that he respects you You told him that you're not interested in him and he took you at your word which he should If you've changed your mind and want to go out with him then invite him out on a date 	 	It means he respected your wishes not to bother you If you want him to pay attention tell him Don't make him guess That's very unfair an experience is one alternative - a chance for someone to try something out and do something different  It will cost you money  but for the recipient it could be an opportunity to try something they could not normally afford or would not have thought about doing  It would therefore be memorable5 and  hopefully  much appreciated 	 	Another practical gift could be to buy someone lessons  giving them a chance to learn new skills such as horse riding or learning English  And there are what are called 'favours'   money-can't-buy offerings to do jobs for someone like babysitting  cleaning or giving someone a massage6  And there is always the fallback of giving vouchers7 to spend in a shop 	 	Of course  if you can't think of an original way to give a gift  the alternative is to not buy anything at all  You may be accused of being a 'Scrooge' but at least you're not wasting money on pointless gifts and you could give the money to charity instead   a more worthy8 cause  But if this year  you receive a present that's not to your liking9 don't be ungrateful and remember the age-old saying that 'it's the thought that counts' book at a typical reading speed 
	 
	Start Listening to Audiobooks
	 
	Before I started listening to audiobooks  I was reading about one book per week and 52 books per year  About two years ago  I implemented10 audiobooks – that put me at around 65 books per year  I don’t listen to audiobooks that much or that often  Usually  I listen to one  maybe two  in a month  But that makes a difference of 10 to 15 books over the course of a year  When I’m walking or driving  I can fit in extra reading time by listening to an audiobook instead of radio or music  When I’m working out in the gym or going for a run  I can squeeze in a few chapters  Or even when I’m cooking  I can throw on an audiobook 
	 
	Each of us have a lot more time in the day than we realize  but that time can often get frittered away if used without intention  Audiobooks are a means of using time more intentionally11 and in a manner conducive12 to a reading goal  They fill in the downtime with books and reading 
	 
	Most audiobooks are between 6 and 10 hours long  some of them push upwards of 12 to 15  But even for longer books  the total time is negligible when spread across weeks or months 
	 
	Consider the math once again: If you have a thirty-minute commute13 to work each way  that is potentially an hour per day to listen to a book  Or  if you only want to listen in the morning  for example  thirty minutes of extra reading per day remains14 excellent – you could get through nearly two  8-hour audiobooks per month at thirty minutes a day  I would be remiss15 to ignore the small faction16 of readers who do not count audiobooks as “reading ” So here is me addressing them  Personally  I do count audiobooks as reading – a book read aloud is still a book 
	 
	By implementing a regular time block for reading each day  reading turns into a habit and becomes automated17  Thinking about when you can “fit in” time to read no longer applies once it becomes a routine part of your day  Soon enough  it becomes an integral piece of your identity as well – you see yourself as a “reader” and so do others  which further motivates and compounds the habit of reading  Next  try out an audiobook  Give yourself a month to listen to one book  you’ll realize that you fly through the book much quicker than this  It’s a fun and leisurely18 way of reading more books  And who doesn’t like being read to by someone else 
	 
	With these two ideas  you and me and everyone else can actually read more books
