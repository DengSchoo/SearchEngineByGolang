We dont have to go out and spend every minute of every day with a rotating1 cast of friends Its about feeling like you are supported in the ways that you want to be supported Tell your friends how long you expect to be off the radar2 how to communicate with you best during this time Im drowning in emails; texts are better and when your schedule is expected to go back to normal When we hear somebody say Im too busy we dont actually know if that is true for just their lives at this time or if thats their way of not really valuing us or wanting to spend time with us It might sound like youre not aiming very high if youre only going to see certain friends once a year but if you have an annual barbecue or Memorial Day party or something where its kind of a guarantee youll see certain friends hing where it's kind of a guarantee you'll see certain friends 		 		25	 	ow. You'll always be with me. And you'll always be my brother.
