Life isnt fair Some people just seem blessed with the ability to effortlessly charm anyone they meet You know the kind of person the one who can strike up a conversation with a complete stranger and end up with a new friend or business lead How do they do it Well it might seem like a magical power but in fact there are a number of factors at work So can you learn to develop superhuman charm The answer is: to a large extent yes you can But first the bad news Scientists have found that people initially1 judge each other based purely2 on physical appearance With just a fleeting3 glimpse of a face people make snap judgements about each others likeability trustworthiness and confidence according to Alexander Todorov professor of psychology4 at Princeton University How to counteract5 this Theres one incredibly simple tool: your smile Todorov told the BBC that people perceive a smiling face as more trustworthy warmer and sociable6 It sounds like common sense doesnt it Smile and others will smile with you What other tricks might we have up our sleeves Former FBI agent Jack7 Schafer has been trained in how to influence people He told BBC Capital: Our brains are always surveying the environment for friend or foe8 signals Three things we can do to signal that we are not a threat are to: raise our eyebrows9 quickly tilt10 our heads slightly and once again to smile So weve looked at body language but of course what you say is hugely important too unless you want to just stand there grinning foolishly Here Schafer recommends that the golden rule of friendship is if you make people feel good about themselves theyre going to like you In other words you need to show interest in them instead of talking about yourself and all your wonderful achievements And while youre chatting remember this: another way of showing interest is to mirror their physical position Another way to form a connection Find common ground Suzanne de Janasz a professor of management with Seattle University says that charming people are particularly adept11 at seeking out shared interests or experiences to help them build rapport12 Simple things like asking where someones from really can open up a discussion and allow you to find areas in common And if all else fails you can fall back on that most British of topics: the weather Glorious day isnt it  of topics: the weather Glorious day isn't it t look 	2-3	 	A process of to-and-fro between editor publisher sales and marketing continues until everyone is happy 		 	50	 	A quick design process might involve seven or eight different iterations before a final design is chosen followed by a process of fine-tuning (make the title bigger try a script font Marketing wants the author in gold foil etc) A painful design process can involve dozens of covers; There is a record of 50 different approaches for the one cover Excruciating 	7-850	 	People are often surprised how little input9 authors have in the design process considering the cover is how their book first faces the world It's important to consider two factors 		 	First most authors are happy to defer10 to the publisher about how to sell as many copies of their book as possible; publishing is a commercial business and the publisher knows the market 		 	Second while the design process is happening the author is generally in the last harrowing stage of editing their manuscript and doesn't want any distraction11 This said if an author hates a cover it will go back to the drawing board but if everyone has done their job well this shouldn't happen 		 	Once the design is finalized12 digital files are sent to a production house so copies of the book can be printed bound and delivered to the publisher's warehouse13 from where they will be shipped to bookstores when wanted 		 		 	and treasured up on purpose to a life beyond life.
