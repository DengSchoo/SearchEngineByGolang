Progressive future and successful life require discipline and character These things are embedded1 into the pattern of our lives through proper education and interaction with fellow human beings  A solid foundation of time tested nurtured2 values attach a character to each and every one of us Finally wherever we go we carry our character sub-consciously with us  A person is character personified only if he has enough creibility Credibility is an essential attribute that is built on the elements of integrity reliability3 veracity4 competence5 and commitment Credibility shines in those people who are ethically6 motivated Credibility is an important tool in improving your people skills Credibility ensures a person to win the genuine respect confidence and trust of others To build up enough credibility we have to have a gel of following elements  Integrity: In simple words it means standing7 for your values and be firm on your view Integrity is an essential factor to win the adulation and trust of others Intergrity is the solidarity8 with which you make your presence felt  Reliability: reliability is a very addictive9 breeding ground for mutual10 trust and improved interpersonal relations Evidence of reliability lies in the consistency11 with which we deliver on commitment promises and statements  Competence: competence is the combined effort of knowledge application experience andconscientions effort to the best possible solution for a given problem When deadlines have to be met at the earliest a person's competence is the only handy tool that will see him through that deadline A competent person has no ifs and buts in his vocabulary He won't fix a blame for failure on something or someone but will modulate12 himself to rectify13 the situation  Commitment: A proper canalization of one's energy enthusiasm talent and thoughts into completing a given project or thoughts is commitment Commitment calls in for a firm mental resolve to fulfill14 the job at hand and see it through A committed person won't rest on his laurels15 till he has completed his duty  No one is born perfect But one can hone one's skills by being true to oneself Early realization16 of the important change in your life can take you places So be far sighted and yes do let me know the results s  He had more dates than me and all the girls loved him  Boy  sometimes I was jealous  Today was one of those days  I can see that he was nervous about his speech  So  I smacked5 him on the back and said  "Hey  big guy  you'll be great " He looked at me with one of those looks (the really grateful one) and smiled "Thanks " he said  As he started his speech  he cleared his throat  and began  "Graduation is a time to thank those who helped you make it through those tough years  Your parents  your teachers  your siblings6  maybe a coach     but mostly your friends  I am here to tell all of you that being a friend to someone is the best gift you can give him or her  I am going to tell you a story " I just looked at my friend with disbelief as he told the story of the first day we met  He had planned to kill himself over the weekend  He talked of how he had cleaned out his locker7 so his Mom wouldn't have to do it later and was carrying his stuff home  He looked hard at me and gave me a little smile  "Thankfully  I was saved  My friend saved me from doing the unspeakable " I heard the gasp8 go through the crowd as this handsome  popular boy told us all about his weakest moment  I saw his Mom and Dad looking at me and smiling that same grateful smile  Not until that moment did I realize it's depth  Never underestimate the power of your actions  With one small gesture you can change a person's life  For better or for worse
