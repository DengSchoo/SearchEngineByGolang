There is a saying that who you socialize with defines who you are I find it very inspiring Find a healthier socializing way Dont fall into the pit of gossip especially not in the office The reason some people participate in workplace gossip in the first place is that they are afraid of being isolated1 If this is exactly your situation then you are drinking poison to quench2 thirst One of the worst things of workplace gossip is that it does not have much logic3 Participants simply hope that other people will recognize their opinions so that they themselves can get emotional satisfaction People who share the same opinions as them are friends otherwise they are enemies Whether the gossip concerns the family life of a colleague or private life of a celebrity4 it is essentially5 the same Such kind of socializing will not give you any chance of selfimprovement Instead it may lead you to a moral abduction It would be better for you to take some courses and learn skills that interest you on your spare time Or you can join some hobby groups and meet likeminded people There goes an old saying: We would rather fight with a sensible person than argue with an idiot ld rather fight with a sensible person than argue with an idiot 	s research also seems to suggest that the more we post on a platform the more socially attractive we become  provided that the posts that we bang out are positive Even back in 2015 Gwendolyn Seidman PhD said that we should avoiding whining2 and being negative online We should also steer3 clear of showing off bragging4 or flexing5 as it's now known  especially about our love lives It makes sense  if your date is going 'that well' would you really have time to share a photo with text 	Â 	So how can you know if you are oversharing Well why not ask your friends in real life They would probably be more than happy to tell you if your posts about your breakfast or your gripes about your lack of money really are too much  go well they run the risk of being labelled has-beens and tarnishing13 their reputation But if their sound is as good as it ever was and the fans are happy then who's going to complain After all you can never have too much of a good thing can also make their own judgement and decide if this is really the career move they want to make
